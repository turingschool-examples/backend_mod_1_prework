## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
 * ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"]

2. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

3. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
 * animals[1]

4. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
 * animals << "lion"

5. Name and describe two additional array methods:
 * array.pop - will delete the last object in the array.
 * array.delete_at(integer) - will delete an item you specify from the array

6. What are the boolean values in Ruby?
 * true
 * false

7. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
 * 2 == 25 this evaluation is false as 25, in fact, does not equal 2

8. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
 *  25 >= 2 this evaluation is true. 25 is bigger than 2
