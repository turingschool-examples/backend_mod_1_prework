## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
the purpose of a method is to extract common code to one place. It allows a programmer to create their own mini scripts.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello
puts "Sam I am"
end

hello

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
end

hello_someone

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
you simply call it by typing it in its own line, as seen in line 18.

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
I am curious if there are any Object-oriented languages that use the term "function" instead of "method".
