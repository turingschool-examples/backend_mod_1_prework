# Ruby Function Checklist
Use this cheat sheet when writing a method (function)
___

- [ ] Start with `def`
- [ ] Function names should only use characters and underscores
- [ ] Open parenthesis after the function name
- [ ] Arguments are after parenthesis, separated by commas
- [ ] Each argument is unique
- [ ] Close parenthesis after arguments
- [ ] Indent lines of code in the function by two spaces
- [ ] End function with `end`, lined up with leading `def`

When you use or call a function, check these as well:
- [ ] Did you run the function by typing its name?
- [ ] Did you put the `()` character after the name to run it?
- [ ] Did you separate the arguments with commas?
- [ ] End the function with a `)` character
- [ ] Functions that don't have parameters don't need `()` after them, but would it be clearer if you include them anyway?

And remember... **To 'run,' 'call,' or 'use' a function all mean the same thing.**
