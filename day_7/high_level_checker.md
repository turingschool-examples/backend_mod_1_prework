## High levels notes for CheckerBoard

* Step one will be to define the values for height and width. These will need to be defined separately as the height will need to count down, as we add rows, while width will need to remain constant in order to properly print each row.

* Step two will be to determine if the number is even or odd, as these will require a slightly different approach.

* Step three will be to write out code to properly print an even or odd board size

* Step four will be to create a loop that counts down the height value and prints the appropriate line, ending when the height value reaches 0.

* The last step will be to create the actual object and print the board.

#Notes
* the majority of the code was fairly simple, but I was way overthinking  the proper print out for the “odd” board sizes, and rewrote it after taking inspiration from fellow classmates.
