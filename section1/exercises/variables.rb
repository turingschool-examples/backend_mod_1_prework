# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf
p "#{house_elf} , has been given a sock"

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
Caution = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"

p Caution

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
p students + 2



# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
p students - 2


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Kevin"
is_hungry = "sometimes"
number_of_pets = "2"


# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# first_name and is_hungry are string values and number_of_pets have a numerical value as an integer.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Ash Ketchum"
is_hungry = "only at night"
number_of_pets = 5

p first_name
p is_hungry
p number_of_pets

p "The trainer #{first_name} eats #{is_hungry} with #{number_of_pets} pokemon."
# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

p healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks

#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?

  #Yes I ran it in the terminal while working through this exercise.
