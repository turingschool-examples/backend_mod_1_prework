## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method? A method allows you to execute code code repeatedly without having to write the code over and over until you reach the number of times you want it executed.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello(words)
  puts words
end

hello("Sam I am")

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  puts name + 'I am'
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone(name)
