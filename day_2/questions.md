## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.

* ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

* animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]

1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

* animals[1]

1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

* animals.push("Lion")

1. Name and describe two additional array methods:

* Insert
    * The insert method allows for a new element to be added to an array at a specified position.
    * array.insert (index, "new element")
* Drop
    * The drop method allows for elements to be accessed within a specified range of indexes. In other words, this method returns elements after a set number, n, so that everything after the specified index can be viewed on its own.
    * array.drop(index)

1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?

* && (and)
* || (or)
* ! (not)
* != (not equal)
* == (equal)
* >= (greater-than-equal)

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
