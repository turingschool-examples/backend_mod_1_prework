## Day 4 Questions

**1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?**

We use methods when we want to want to run the same code multiple times with different inputs. That way, we can save writing time and can conveniently use the method as many times as we want.

**2. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.**

```
def hello ()
  puts "Sam I am."
end
```

**3. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.**

```
def hello_someone (name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
end
```

**4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?**

```
hello_someone("Fenton")
```

**5. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?**

When is it best practice to write the methods in the script vs. writing the method in it's own separate file?
