## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
    - A method is useful when you need to run the same code several times in a program. It is a nice way to consolidate things you may need multiple times.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```
hello_someone("Steve")
```

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
    - Methods are very straightforward and easy to use in Ruby compared to other languages I have used before(Java). So I don't really have any questions (yet)
