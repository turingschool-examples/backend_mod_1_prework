# Mod 0 Final Prep
Congrats on making it to the Mod 0 Final Prep! Complete the final exercises below and be sure to carefully follow the Pull Request steps to submit your work!

### Final Technical Prep

You've learned a ton about some of the core foundations of Javascript! Show us how far you've come by completing the following exercises! You will be using your work from these exercises in your first day of Mod 1!

- [x] Complete the [Mod Zero Hero Challenge](./mod_zero_hero.rb)
- [x] Complete the [Annotation Challenge](./annotations.rb)

### Refactor Previous Work
You've learned A LOT over the last few weeks as it relates to technical content - chances are, you probably have some code from your previous exercises that is either sloppy, incorrect, poorly named, etc. Before starting Mod 1, we want you to `refactor` your code - which is the process of adjusting or improving your code for readability and accuracy.

Some things to consider as you refactor include...
- Are my variable names easy to understand/convey the data type they are assigned to?
- Do I have proper indentation on my functions, if/else statements, etc. ?
- Do I follow proper conventions for capitalization, punctuation, casing, etc. as it relates to my code?
- Are there functions that I wrote that I can make more concise while maintaining same functionality?

Take your time as you go back and refactor your exercises from each section. We've included a handy checklist for you to go through below.

- [x] I have refactored my `section1` exercises to the best of my ability
- [x] I have refactored my `section2` exercises to the best of my ability
- [x] I have refactored my `section3` exercises to the best of my ability
- [x] I have refactored my `section4` exercises to the best of my ability

### Time Management Prep
In Mod 0 you've learned about different techniques for managing your time at Turing. Please create a calendar for your **first 3 weeks of Mod 1**. Feel free to make your calendar fit your style, but we suggest that your calendar should include the following:
- [x] Standard M1 class schedule (see M1 calendar [here](https://backend.turing.io/module1/)
- [x] Study/Project work time
- [x] Health + Wellness

When you are finished, add screenshots of your calendar so we can provide feedback if needed!

### Mentorship Prep
Mentorship is an integral part of the Turing experience and will help jumpstart your technical career. In order to get your mentor relationship started on the right foot, please complete the following deliverables:
- [x] Complete the [Mentorship DTR Prep](https://gist.github.com/ericweissman/51965bdcbf42970d43d817818bfaef3c)
  - [x] Add link to your gist here:

### Lesson Prep
You've learned a lot about how to take strong notes during Mod 0. Show us your skills while you learn how to pre-teach content for your first lesson in Mod 1!
- [x] Complete the [Pre Teaching Practice exercise](https://gist.github.com/ericweissman/0036e8fe272c02bd6d4bb14f42fd2f79) gist

  - [x] Add a link to your gist here:

### Group Work Prep
As part of Turing's project-based learning approach, you will often be working in pairs or larger groups. In order to set yourself (and your team) up for success, it is important to ensure you are prepared to be an equitable contributor and teammate.
- [x] Complete the [DTR Guiding Questions](https://gist.github.com/ericweissman/c56f3a98cdce761808c21d498a52f5c6)

5. Please complete the form to submit your prework available [here](https://forms.gle/wxoVuhHKjrRyvGW2A). Be sure to include links for your Gear Up pre-work gist and your technical pre-work GitHub repository. The link to your technical pre-work GitHub repository will be in the format https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/frontend-mod-1-prework. (using _your_ own GitHub username)

## Next Steps

Depending on if you are in Section A or B, you have anywhere between 1.5-3.5 weeks before you start Mod 1. This is an important time to take care of life things such as doctor appointments, dog park trips, quality time with friends and family, etc. It is also important that you maintain the knowledge and skills you acquired during Mod 0 and this pre-work. You can absolutely do both, but to do so successfully, **you need a plan**. We recommend spending, on average, 1-2 hours a day coding (totally 20-40 hours of time).

What is your plan and how are you going to hold yourself to it? Specifically...
- What are you going to work on? [Resources here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/fe-m1-practice)
- What days are you going to work?
- What times on those days are you going to work?
- Where you going to be sitting/standing as you do this?
- Where are you documenting this plan? Google Calendar, calendar on your wall, your journal?
- Do any stakeholders in your life know about this plan? (The answer needs to be yes by the time you answer this...)
- What personal items/events are important to you during this time? How are you going to make sure those are not neglected? (Hint, block time on the calendar for them!)

## Extensions
Check out our thoughts on [extension activities](https://mod0.turing.io/prework/extensions) if you find yourself with some extra time before starting Mod 1!
