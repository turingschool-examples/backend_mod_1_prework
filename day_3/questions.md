## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement is one in which you set conditions and then use boolean logic in your code to determine output based on said conditions.

Examples:

def Nala_the_Golden_Retriever(age)
if age < 2
puts "She's got lots of energy!"
elsif age == 2
puts "She's almost an adult and behaves herself better now."
elsif age == 6
puts "Nala is 30 years old in human years."
else
puts "We all know Nala is 3 years old. Nice try."
end
end

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
