# Common Array Methods:

**Sort:**
The .sort method will return a new array where the elements are sorted. In other words, sort puts the elements of an array in order (alphabetical, numerical, etc).

**Each:**

The .each method will iterate through each element in an array. If you were to call for .each to print/puts strings from an array it would iterate through each element and print them.

**Collect:**

The .collect method will create a new array returning the values specified by the code block or enumerator given. This can be used to perform calculations on an entire array (producing a new array with the results), manipulating an array of strings into a new array, etc.

**First and Last:**

Returns the first or last elements of an array. For example:

`letter = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]`

`letter.first` would return `"a"`

`letter.last` would return `"e"`

**Shuffle:**

The .shuffle method returns a new array with the elements shuffled. For example:

`letter = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]`

`letter.shuffle` _could_ return `["b", "a", "d", "c"]`

 **Join:**

 The .join method will join together all of the elements of an array with a chosen separator if desired.

 **Index:**

 The .index method will tell you the location or address of an element in an array.

 Example:

 `x = ["a", "b", "c"]`

 `x.index(c)` would return: `2`

 **Include?:**

 The .include? method can be used to confirm if an element is present in an array!
