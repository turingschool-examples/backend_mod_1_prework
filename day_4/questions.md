## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is a means of saving a block of code that performs a certain function.
This block of code can be used over and over again by calling it.  The method
will manipulate the data provided to it as a method and return the manipulated data.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello()
  puts "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("John")
