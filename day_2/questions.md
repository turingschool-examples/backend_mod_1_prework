## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.

```ruby
animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]
```

2. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

**Did this**
```ruby
animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]
```

3. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

```ruby
animals[1]
```

**Since the "giraffe" string is located at index 1**

4. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

```ruby
animals.push "lion"
```

5. Name and describe two additional array methods:

`.first` will return the first element in the array and . . .
`.last` will return the last element in the array.

6. What are the boolean values in Ruby?
`true` **and** `false`

7. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?

```ruby
2 == 25
```

8. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?

```ruby
