## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

To put code/work into a repeatable state that is quickly called.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```ruby
def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`hello_someone("Kate")`

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

To be honest, I don't enough to have questions. I need to use them more.
