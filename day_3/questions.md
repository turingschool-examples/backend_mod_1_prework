## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
# A conditional statement evaluates infomation and responds with true or false. They either create or don't create a new branch based on the answer/peratmeters.
# 10 > 7
# dog >= People
# 35 == 35

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
# you use one to run code if the statement is true. for example, if you are an ad agency targeting elderly people, you could have a program that sends people your advertisements if they are over 65, if they are not over that age, they aren't you target audience so you wouldn't "run" the ad to them

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
# if (question)
#   (run peratmeters on statement if true)
# end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
# You would use elsif statements

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
# if (question)
#   (run peratmeters on statement if true)
# elsif
#   (run peratmeters on statement if true)
# else
#   (run peratmeter if statement is "else/not true to pervious")
# end
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
# They could be used to check if your code is fuctioning properly. If you know the result that you are trying to achive, you could use a conditional statement to tell you if your program is running correctly.
