## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

    - The purpose of a method in my eyes is to be able to reuse the same code without having to retype it
    over and over. That is the main functionality of a method to me.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

- ```ruby
     def hello
        print "Sam I am"
     end
  ```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

 - ```ruby
    def hello_someone(name)
       print "#{name} I am"
    end
   ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

   - `hello_someone("Sam")`

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

   - My question about methods in Ruby is if there's a preferred naming convention to them outside of snake_case It seems like there's a lot of preferable styling in Ruby, so I'd like to know if there is a specific way Rubyists want to name their methods.
