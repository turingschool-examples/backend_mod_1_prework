## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
A hash is indexed by keys, while an array is indexed by integer.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {chew_toys: 23, hamsters: 507, fish: 48}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
pet_store.keys , pet_store.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
You might use a hash, if you are collecting cars of different years. Hash is better in this case because
while an array is indexed by integers, a hash can use any object type to index.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
None. Thank you!
