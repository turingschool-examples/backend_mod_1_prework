## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

_conditional statements are statements whose answers are true or false. Such as, == which means equal, || which means or, and != which means not equal._

2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

_You would use if-statements to create blocks of code. You will use them when you want the program to run certain decisions only if certain input or variables are true/false._

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

_The ruby sytax is as follows._
``` ruby
    if object boolean
      decision
    end
```

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

_You can use conditional branching by making defitions with blocked if statements. You can also create if statements inside of if statements (this is called nesting). When doing this, be cautious of your indent block and always remember to close the block with 'end'. Finally, you can use || and && and various other truth statements, even in a single line of code._

5. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

_The ruby sytax is as follows._
``` ruby
    if object boolean
      decision
    elsif object boolean
      decision
    else
      decision
    end
```

6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

_I can imagine when you use the conditional operators using ruby as a calculator or checking in the irb._
