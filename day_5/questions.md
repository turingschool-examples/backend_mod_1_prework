## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
both are collections. arrays are ordered and hashes are not. A hash has a key, value pair and an array's element is identified by it's index.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {"cat food cans": 100, "bags of dog food": 10}
1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states["IA"]
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
states.keys
states.values
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
what is in the pantry, in this case we can store the item and the amount, whereas in an array you would not be able to store both.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
n/a
