## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
    A condition statement is an if-then statement.  You list different comparisons that your variables could follow, and if those conditions are met and true, you tell your code to do something, like print a text string.

    ex1: if your tea has been steeping for more than 3 minutes, remove the tea bag

    ex2: if you woke up late for work, skip breakfast today

    ex3: if your dog is whining, take him for a walk

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
    If you have multiple input variables and the different combinations of those variables illicit differing results, you would want to use an if-statement to return appropriate outputs based on your specific input values and their interactions.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
    if variable == some_value
      puts something (p "something")
    end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
    elsif

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
    if variable == some_value
      do something (p "some text")
    elsif variable == another_value
      do another thing (p "another text")
    else
      do something else (p "else")
    end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
  conditional statements evaluate if some statement is true or false, so you can use conditional statements with boolean logic as well
