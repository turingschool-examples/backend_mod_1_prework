## Array methods

### 1. `sort`

This method will return an array where the elements within the original array are now sorted. For strings, they get sorted in alphabetical order. And for numbers, they get sorted in increasing value order

### 2. `each`

This method will perform a specific task to each element in the array. It essentially repeats the task until it reaches the end of the array.

### 3. `join`

The method join will bring together the elements of an array into one single string. A separator should be specified. If a separator is not specified, the method will join the elements without spaces.

### 4. `index`

This method finds the index of a certain element of an array instance. Kind of like finding the location of an element in an array.

### 5. `include?`

This method is used to determine if a specific element is present in an array. If the element is present, it returns true. If it is not present, it returns false.

### 6. `collect`

This method performs a given block one time for each element of the array. A new array is returned with the specified block.

### 7. `first`

This method will return the first and only the first element of the array. You can also return the first set of elements where n would specify how many elements are desired.

### 8. `last`

This method returns the last element of the array. You can also specify a set of last elements by specifying how many you want returned. For example, the last 2 or last 8.

### 9. `shuffle`

This method will return the array such that each element is now in a different place/order compared to its original order.
