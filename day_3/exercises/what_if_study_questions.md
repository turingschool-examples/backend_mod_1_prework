If statements will test if the code under it passes or fails a set of parameters and if the code does, it will do the next command.
The code under the if needs to be indented because it is part of a block and the indent says "look at the stuff below that's indented for the parameters"
If the code isn't indented, the computer will take that code as a regular command.
Yes, and it will test both of the parameters and only do the thing if you specify it is true or false. EX: && statements will test if the statement is true or false and then do whatever you based on if you want the answer to be true or false.
If you change the initial values then the statements will change from true or false and what is printed will depend on if those statements are still true with different values.
