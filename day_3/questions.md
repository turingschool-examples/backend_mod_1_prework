## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
```ruby
# A conditional statement is one resulting in true or false depending
# on specified criteria (e.g., 2 < 3, .nil? method)

1 < 2

animals = []
animals.nil?

animals.include?("lion")
```

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

```ruby
# When you want multiple branches depending on user or data input.
# You can effectively write much more complex code using conditionals.
```

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```ruby
if x #conditional statement
  y # action desired if above true"
elsif x1 # additional conditional, if needed (not necessary)
  y1
else y2 # additional action desired if all above false (not required)
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
   See above! You can just keep adding elsif statements!

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```ruby
if cars > 5 #conditional statement
  p "This guy really loves cars" # action desired if above true"
elsif cars > 10 # additional conditional, if needed (not necessary)
  p "This man has too many toys"
else p "Somebody get this man some more cars!" # additional action desired if all above false (not required)
```   

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
```ruby
# If we want to understand if an array is empty
animals = []
animals.nil?
# If I want to know if a lion is in my array
animals = ["giraffe", "lion"]
animals.include?("lion")
