## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

it's basically a sentence that uses the word 'if', or some equivalent.

* if you have the password, then you can enter.
* if it is raining, then the ground is wet.
* if the moon in made of green cheese, then blubber is gray.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

because sometimes you need something to happen only if certain conditions are met.


1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if conditional
  execute code
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

you use the term "elsif"


1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

if x == 1
  print "no"
elsif x == 2
  print "yes"
elsif == 3
  print "perhaps"
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

not really. i consider the statement "unless you do this, that will happen"  to be an if statement, because it is logically equivalent to, "IF you do NOT do this, THEN that will happen", even though it technically does not have the word 'if' in it. from this perspective, you can't have a conditional statement that is not also, at least indirectly an if-statement.
