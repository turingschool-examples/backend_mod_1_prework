## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.

animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"]

2. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"]

3. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

`animals[-1]`

4. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

`animals.push("lion")`

5. Name and describe two additional array methods:

The `.push` method of adding files works as in the syntax above.  This method passes the elements defined by the user to the array.  This is an alternative to the following `animals << "lion"`.

The `.size` method can tell you the length in characters of a variable.

6. What are the boolean values in Ruby?

true and false

7. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
```
2 == 25
false
```
8. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?

`25 > 2    true`
