#Study Drills:

#Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
#Remember in Exercise 0 when you started irb? Start irb this way again and, using the math operators, use Ruby as a calculator.
#Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.
#Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.

# This will print "I will now count my chickens:"
puts "I will now count my chickens:"
# This will count the hens and roosters:
puts "Hens #{25.5+30.4/6.0}"
puts "Roosters #{100.5 - 25.2 * 3.3 % 4.0}"
# This will print "Now I will count the eggs:"
puts "Now I will count the eggs:"
# This will count the eggs
puts 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.0 +4.0 % 2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6.0
# This will print a question
puts "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"
# This performs a calculation that answers the above question
puts 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 - 7.0
# These print questions and answer those questions with calculations on the same line.
puts "What is 3.0 + 2.0? #{3.0 + 2.0}"
puts "What is 5.0 - 7.0? #{5.0 - 7.0}"
# This prints "Oh, that's why it's false"
puts "Oh, that's why it's false."
# This prints "How about some more."
puts "How about some more."
# These print questions and answer those questions with calculations on the same lines.
