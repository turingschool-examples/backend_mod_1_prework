# Study Drills
    #1
        # the gets part of gets.chomp you can ask the user a question that returns as a string.
        # the chomp part of gets.chomp gets rid of the \n at the end of
            # the string.

      #This example didn't make sense to me, getting a new one.
        # =>        x = gets
        # =>        y = gets
        # =>        puts x+y

        # =>        x = gets.chomp
        # =>        y = gets.chomp
        # =>        puts x+y

      #This example Names helped me understand better.  Even though I couldn't get the strings to have a space in between.
        #print "What is your name?"

        #print "So your name is #{name} and your favorite color is #{color}, what else should I know about you?"
        #random_fact = gets.chomp
        #print " And you like to #{random_fact}, interesting!"
