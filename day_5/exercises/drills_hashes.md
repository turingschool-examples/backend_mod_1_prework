EX.39 - HASHES: Study Drills (LRTHW)
1)  Colorado is abbreviated CO, CO has the city Denver
      states["Colorado"] = "CO"
    New Mexico is abbreviated NM, NM has the city Taos
      states["New Mexico"] = "NM"

2)  cities.merge({CO => Denver, NM => Taos})
    cities.size   5
    cities.keys   ["CA", "MI", "FL", "CO", "NM"]

3)  Hashes seem to not work in the opposite direction, calling the value (after the hash rocket) to get the key.
