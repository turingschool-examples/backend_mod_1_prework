## Day 4 Questions

### 1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
A *method* is a block of code that accomplishes a specific task. It acts like a zip lock bag. You store a task inside of it, and whenever you need it again, you can just simply take it out.

### 2. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```ruby
def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

hello
```


### 3. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

name = "Jonathan"
```

### 4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
You would run the method by calling ```hello_someone(name)```

### 5. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
When specifically would you be using a method? If you are at your job, what circumstances would direct you to using a method? Trying to wrap my head around real world situations to help me know when this is best applied. Thanks!
