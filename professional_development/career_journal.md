## Career Journal / Pairin Survey

*When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?*

My previous careers in project management and grant/technical writing were extremely deadline driven and I relied heavily on calendars, task lists, and reminders. At Turing I plan to do my best to scan the lessons ahead of time and build a structure for completing homework and projects. As I learn more about the projects, I will populate my tasks and amend any calendars or deadlines accordingly.

*As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?*

One of my strengths is curiosity. I know this because I have been able to excel in many different fields based on my willingess to learn and ask why. Each time I entered a new field of work and recieved initial training, I never simply accepted that things were done the way they were because "That's the way it has always been." If I encountered a process or procedure that was inefficient or outmoded, I took steps to improve the workflow.

*Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):*

If I am working on a project that requires individual focus and concentration, I prefer a well-lit, quiet room or an environment where the use of noise-cancelling headphones is acceptable. If I am working on a collaborative project, I prefer to approach my work with some structure and individually assigned deliverables where a collaborative troubleshooting or editing session occurs at scheduled intervals.

*As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?*

The greatest area of improvement that I would like to see is discipline and patience. First and foremost, I'd like to feel more patient with myself when it comes to the speed at which I learn or struggle with a new skill. I am certain that I will need this skill at every point of my career moving forward.

*How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?*

Any project's success is dependent on the identification of a teams' strengths and weakness and as a team member or team leader I would have to be honest about my own skill level to avoid serving as a hindrance to the project. Understanding my working preferences will help me identify work environments where I will thrive or struggle.

*Describe the vision you currently have for your career after Turing:*

I would like to spend a year or two as a junior developer to enhance my skills and comfort level. If I enjoy the work or find a product that excites me, I could see myself moving into a project manager or technical writer role.
