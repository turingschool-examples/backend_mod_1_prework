5. Please complete the form to submit your prework available [here](https://forms.gle/wxoVuhHKjrRyvGW2A). Be sure to include links for your Gear Up pre-work gist and your technical pre-work GitHub repository. The link to your technical pre-work GitHub repository will be in the format https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/frontend-mod-1-prework. (using _your_ own GitHub username)

## Next Steps

Depending on if you are in Section A or B, you have anywhere between 1.5-3.5 weeks before you start Mod 1. This is an important time to take care of life things such as doctor appointments, dog park trips, quality time with friends and family, etc. It is also important that you maintain the knowledge and skills you acquired during Mod 0 and this pre-work. You can absolutely do both, but to do so successfully, **you need a plan**. We recommend spending, on average, 1-2 hours a day coding (totally 20-40 hours of time).

What is your plan and how are you going to hold yourself to it? Specifically...
- What are you going to work on? [Resources here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/fe-m1-practice)
- What days are you going to work?
- What times on those days are you going to work?
- Where you going to be sitting/standing as you do this?
- Where are you documenting this plan? Google Calendar, calendar on your wall, your journal?
- Do any stakeholders in your life know about this plan? (The answer needs to be yes by the time you answer this...)
- What personal items/events are important to you during this time? How are you going to make sure those are not neglected? (Hint, block time on the calendar for them!)

## Extensions
If you're interested in challenging yourself _even more_ and getting a step ahead in your coding abilities before your first day, we recommend working on either:

- [Turing's ruby exercises repo](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises)
- [A back-end grad's advice and useful study resources](https://josh.works/turing-backend-prep-01-intro)
- [Credit Check](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/credit_check).

If you do Credit Check, follow the [same steps](#forking-the-module-1-prework-repository) as you did previously to fork and clone this repo on to your local computer.
