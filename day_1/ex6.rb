# string concatenation
puts w + e





# to answer #3 of study drills: adding two strings w and e with a + makes a longer string
# through string cancatenation

# if you change strings to use '' instead of "" it works up until you need to add another
# pair of quotes
# double quotes are good practice in case you need to use quotes again, you can use single
# quotes inside of double quotes
