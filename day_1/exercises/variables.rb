# In the below exercises, write code that achieves

# `ruby day_1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf


# Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and print that variable to the terminal:

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
