#Ex30 Study Drills

##1. Try to guess what `elsif` and `else` are doing.

  I think that `elsif` seems to be used to provide a *specific* alternative condition, along with code to execute if that condition returns a value of true. `else` seems to be more general, and includes code to execute if none of the `if` or `elsif` conditions return a true value.

##2. Change the numbers of `cars`, `people`, and `trucks`, and then trace through each `if-statement` to see what will be printed.

  Done && done!

##3. Try some more complex boolean expressions like `cars > people || trucks < cars`.

  Done!

##4. Above each line write and English description of what the line does.

  Done.
