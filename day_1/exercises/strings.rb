# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result. You should be able to run this
# file from your terminal with the command `ruby day_1/exercises/strings.rb`

# example: Write code below to print your name to the terminal:
p "William Fischer" # note, this prints the value of var.inspect, not var.to_str
# So, p is good for debugging, while puts is more suitable for an output for users

# Write code below to print `Welcome to Turing!` to the terminal:
p "'Welcome to Turing!'"

# Write code below to print `99 bottles of pop on the wall...`:
p "'99 bottles of pop on the wall...'"
