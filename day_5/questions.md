## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
 - A hash allows you to store a value that is tied with an index

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
pet_store = {fish: 4, dog: 8, cat: 5, kibble: 6}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
 - You would identify the specific index you want to access I.E `states.values[1]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
 - You simply `p states.keys` and `p states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
 - I like using hashes because you can store additional information, such as when entering information in a list, you can store the states as both the 2 letter state code as well as the full name of the state

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
