Objects are created by defining a class and then assinging a specific variable as a new instance of that class

'''

class Furniture
end

chair = furniture.new

A module allows us to to group reusable code in a single place. They can be
used with classes by using the "include" method followed by the model name

module Study
end

class MyClass
include study
end

my_obj = MyClass.new
