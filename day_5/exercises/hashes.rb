# at the zoo. (an inventory of animals)
zoo = {zebras: 4, elephants: 5, monkeys: 35, penguins: 31, llamas: 6}
p zoo

# Using the zoo that you created above, print all the keys in the hash.
p zoo.keys

# Using the zoo that you created above, print all the values in the hash.
p zoo.values

# Using the zoo that you created above, print the value of the first item in
# the hash
p "#{zoo[:zebras]}"

# Add an animal to the zoo hash and print the updated hash.
zoo[:antelope] = 79
p zoo
