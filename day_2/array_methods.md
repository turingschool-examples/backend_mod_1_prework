# This is a documentation about methods in array class  
1. .last  
    1. method in array returns the last object in the array. If I have an array with 7 object, the `.last` method will return the 7th object to me.  
1. .sort method  
    1. method in array lets you sort the array. Sort will return a new array of the previously sorted array, where as `sort!` will change the original array after sorting it.  
    1. .sort_by - we can use sort_by to sort by a category of data. Say by numbeers or lengths of word.  
1. .each  
    1. this method goes through each object in the array and performs the command we write in our code. For instance we could use `.each` to identify strings in an array with an even length.  
1. .collect  
    1. This method is also enumerator in that it goes through each object in the array and collects and returns values based on the specification we provide. If we use `.collect` with `.upcase` over an array the resulting array will be an array of objects in all CAPS.  
1. .shuffle  
    1. `.shuffle` is used to randomly shuffle the objects of an array.
