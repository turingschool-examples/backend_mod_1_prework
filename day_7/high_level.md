#Checker Board
`The first thing I would do when writing this program is get input from the user for how big of a checkerboard they want. Then I would create a range up to the number the user entered. The program would go through each number in the range and if the number was even it would print " X X X" and if the number was odd it would print "X X X". The program would stop once the range ends.`
