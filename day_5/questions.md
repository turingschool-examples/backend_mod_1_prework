## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
A hash allows you to assign a key and a value in a collection.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {Geckos: 20, Hamsters: 10, Parrots: 3}
1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
states.keys

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
recipe = {"eggs" => 2, "onion" => 0.5, "turkey_sausage" => 1, "cheese" =>0.25, "tortilla" => 1, "green_chile" => 0.01}

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
Probably a bunch, I just don't know what they are yet.
