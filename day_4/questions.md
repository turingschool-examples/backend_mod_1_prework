## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
It is an expression used to be more efficient, and to usually return a value.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello
  "Sam I am"
end
puts hello

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am."
end

hello_someone("Noah Flint")

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
By calling on the folder, in my case I would type 'ruby Scrap2.rb' into my terminal.

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
None really, I am still absorbing the information I have received so far.
