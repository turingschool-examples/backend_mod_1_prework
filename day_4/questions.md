## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is a code written with the intention of being used multiple times throughout a program. Modifying a code is easier with a method than when you have to adjust each set of data stored in separate variables.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

``` Ruby
def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

hello
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

``` Ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

hello_someone("Sam")
```


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Sam")

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

I think I have a decent understanding of methods but need to keep practicing. Mostly am having trouble with the methods involving integers and really struggled with the puzzle portion of ex21.
