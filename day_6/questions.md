**1. What is an attribute of a Class?**

An attribute is defined as a characteristic that every instance of a class possesses.


**1. What is behavior of a Class?**

The different behaviors, or actions, of a class are referred to as methods.  


**1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:**


class: Dog

attributes: fur_color, eye_color, name

**1. How do you create an instance of a class?**

Creating a new object or instance of a class is called instantiation.  The primary act of this particular workflow is utilizing the 'new' method.  For example, using the above class, the ruby syntax would read as follows:  Rusty = Dog.new.  'Rusty' is now a newly created instance within the Dog class.
