# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Brant"
puts name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
warning = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
puts warning

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students += 2
puts students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students -= 2
puts students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
first_name = "Brant"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 0

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# If I were to add a question mark to the end of each variable, I could see the
# appropriate data type. When prompting for a first name, a string is the appropriate response.
# When asking if you are hungry, you might respond with yes or no. That is a true/false answer
# which is perfect for a boolean. Also, many boolean variables start with is_ or has_.
# number_of_pets has 'number' right there in the name.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Clark"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 1

puts first_name
puts is_hungry
puts number_of_pets


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
