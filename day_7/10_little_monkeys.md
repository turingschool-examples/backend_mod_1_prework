## 10 Little Monkeys

Create a file named 10_little_monkeys.rb and within that file, write a program that will print the following nursery rhyme, but for *10* monkeys.

> Three little monkeys jumping on the bed,  
> One fell off and bumped his head,  
> Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,  
> "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"
>
> Two little monkeys jumping on the bed,  
> One fell off and bumped his head,  
> Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,  
> "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"
>
> One little monkey jumping on the bed,  
> He fell off and bumped his head,  
> Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,  
> "Get those monkeys right to bed!"

### Bonus
Can you write the program so that it will run for any number of monkeys?

If I could figure out how to include the 'humanize' gem I could do it easily.

Or, If I could just use numbers instead of using the word.

But, It would be quite some logic to figure out how to convert __all__ numbers into their word counterparts.
