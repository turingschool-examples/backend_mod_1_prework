cities = Hash.new('DefaultTest') # Example of setting new default
puts cities
city = cities['TX']
city ||= 'Does Not Exist' # resets value if original value is nil
puts "The city for the state 'TX' is: #{city}"

# The above doesn't really set a default. 'a ||= b' works like 'a || (a = b)'.
# It checks to see if 'a' is true (i.e. neither nil nor false). If it is, the
# "or" condition is true, so 'a = b' isn't "evaluated." That is, a isn't set
# to b.

# Interesting application: hashvar[id] ||= "new value" sets the id key to the
# 'new value' value ONLY IF it has a value already (or if the default is not nil)

# To really set the default, use cities.new('Does Not Exist')
# In that case, any reference to a key that isn't in the dictionary will return
# the specified default string, rather than 'nil'

# Also awesome: objects can be used to key hashes. Doesn't have to be a standard
# type.

# Hashes aren't ordered, so you can't directly sort them. However, you can
# pull the keys into an array and sort those, then iterate through that array
# to access the values. For example:

# numbered in reverse order to illustrate the point
unordered = {'b' => 4, 'a' => 5, 'd' => 2, 'e' => 1, 'c' => 3}
unordered.keys.sort.each do |key|
  puts "#{key}: #{unordered[key]}"
end

# Or to sort by the values, which ignores keys.
puts '-' * 10
unordered.values.sort.each do |value|
  puts value
end
