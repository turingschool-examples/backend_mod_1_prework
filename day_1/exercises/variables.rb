# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this

# `ruby day_1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
more_students = students + 2
