## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

  If you have some code that needs to be executed a bunch of times throughout your program instead of writing code for each individual instance you can use a method just once in your code that executes that issue every time it comes up in your program.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  ```ruby
  def hello
    puts "Sam I am"
  end
  ```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

  ```ruby
  def hello_someone(name)
    puts "#{name} I am"
  end
  ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

  `hello_someone("Insert name here")`

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

  No questions right now.  I just feel like I need more practice in order to really feel comfortable with them.
