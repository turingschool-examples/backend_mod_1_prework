## Checker Board

1. Create a file called checker_board.rb
2. Think about what you know about required output
- 2.1 The Checker board pattern alternates starting with an "X" and starting with a space in an odd/even pattern
- 2.2 think about how to define even and odd: a.even? (boolean), a % 2 == 0
- 2.3 even = "X X X"; odd = " X X X"
3. Think about user input. (gets.chomp)
- 3.1 Think about how to use numeric input.  
- 3.2 Input is a string, gets.chomp to_i?
- 3.3 use number to make an array for iteration?
4. Think about order of writing
- 4.1 first things first. User input.
- 4.2 convert input to integer  
- 4.3 create array using user supplied integer.
- 4.4 iteration over array
- 4.5 determine even/odd
- 4.6 puts, not print
- 4.7 write output associated with each number
5. write it and try it
if it works, got to step 7
    if not
6. correct mistakes
- 6.1 use error messages to find mistakes
- 6.2 google error messages if needed
- 6.3 try to understand why it didn't work
- 6.4 research possible solutions
- 6.5 go to whichever step in 4. the problem is, and start there.
7. celebrate
