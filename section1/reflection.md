## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I was pleasantly surprised to find that I already have several of the SuperLearner attributes. I think that is why my first response was that the article was underwhelming. I already read a good amount everyday but that is usually news and not in the form of fiction or non-fiction novels. I really enjoy teaching others what I know or what Iâ€™ve discovered. I have seen it in many forms. I have taught my classmates as we were studying for tests in college. When I find a new concept, I love to share it with my brother or any of my friends I think may enjoy that information as well. I take short breaks early and often which I always thought was a form of laziness. For the most part I enjoy the journey of learning. That is evident by looking at my 3 undergraduate degrees. I typically watch YouTube or read articles in order to learn and stay informed rather than just to seek entertainment. I mostly eat a very healthy diet thanks to my wife, but I think it would be simple to make small tweaks to have my diet geared toward anti-cognitive decline. I love the idea of growth and improvement but maybe I should take steps to gamify my growth. I think the idea of trying to break stuff to learn how it works or the idea of being curious enough to figure out how something works is another thing that SuperLearners do.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

`animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

`puts animal`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

Interpolation is a way to insert data into a string by referencing that data through a variable.

`puts "Every time I travel from Lubbock to Austin, I have to look for the #{animal}s in Zephyr!"`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

`gets.chomp` will get input from a method but will not include `\n` in the input.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
`.split()` splits a string into an array. The elements inside the created array are split based on the input in the `.split()` method.
`.length` returns the number of characters in the string.
