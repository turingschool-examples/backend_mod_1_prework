## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
Instead of printing out code that we will use over and over again, we can just put that code in a container and call that container of code. It makes is simple for us.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end


1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
hello_someone("Jimmy")


1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
Nothing as of right now.
