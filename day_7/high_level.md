## Solving the Caesar Cipher.

 The Caesar Cipher, takes data input and shifts the alphabet in either direction in any variable.  You could shift 26, and it would read the same!  To figure out how to code this.  I will set an array with the alphabet.  Pull the data from the "puts" or user inputted data, using .maps or .fetch.  then run it through a def method that will hash the alphabet, using the .rotate method to shift all characters to the right 3 points.  Then decoding using fetch, pulling the shifted data from the hash. 

 ##Research

 I utilized google to understand a little more about the caesar cipher and different methods for writing one.  The method that I think could be utilized best using the .ord method to convert the string data into ascii numbers.  then just adding a defined amount to shift left or right.  But for this project, I was more comfortable setting the array/ hash, pulling the data, and running it through the .rotate method. I dont understand the ascii values yet.
