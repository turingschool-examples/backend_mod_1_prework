## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.  
* A conditional statement lays out conditions based on which a decision is made if the condition is met. For example:  
  1. if i have a guitar, i should play it for people.  
  1. if i am above 18 and eligible, I should vote.  
  1. if i prefer cats over dogs, i need to rethink my choices in life.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?  
* we could want to use an if statement to write execute different actions for different conditions.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?  
*
``` 
if something == true
    #do this
  end
```  

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?  
* by adding elsif

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:  
*
```
weather = rainy
if weather == rainy
  puts "put on a hat"
elsif weather == sunny
  puts "you dont need a sweater"
else
  puts "check the weather"
end
```    

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?  
* every example i am thinking of is somehow linked to an if-statement. We could perhaps set conditions within which our block of code would run and outside of it, the code would not execute. However, i feel like even that would be an if-statement.
