# STUDY DRILLS
# 1. I made a comment above every line explaining what it does
# 2. Type irb into your terminal will let you use Ruby as a calculator
# 3. I created a shirt_color.rb file to calculate how many colored shirts I have
# 4. I rewrote all integers in this script to floating points to make it more accurate.
# I played around with floating points on the later half of the script which is why it is not the same as the original
