## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
    - Methods in ruby are just like functions in other languages. We would use methods to save pieces of code that we use often in our program. This way we can invoke the method instead of re-typing the same code over and over again.
1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
    ```
        def hello
            p "Sam I am"
        end

        hello
    ```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
    ```
        def hello_someone(name)
            p "#{name} I am"
        end

    ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

    `hello_someone("Anne")`

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
    - I feel pretty comfortable with the basics of methods.
