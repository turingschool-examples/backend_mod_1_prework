## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to return a value based on the code within the body.

2. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```
def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end
```

3. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```
4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

hello_someone()
```

5. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

Still wrapping my head around the return part of a + b and having it assigned to a variable. But I'm working through it with more practice.
