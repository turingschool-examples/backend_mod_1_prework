## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
* To perform an action on a string, integers, or arrays.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```ruby
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```ruby
hello_someone("Sam")
```

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
* I've done some researching and reading and *mostly* get the difference between a method and a function, but I would say I'm only about 90% sure about the differences.
