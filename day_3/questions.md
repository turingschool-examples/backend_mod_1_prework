## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

Conditional statements evaluate to `true` and `false`.

Examples:
* `<=`

An if statement is helpful if there are specific conditions that need to be met in order for certain code to be applicable.

```Ruby
if this

`elsif` and `else` are used for additional if statements.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

```ruby
if x < 5
  puts "x is less than 5."

else
  puts "x is 5."
end
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

If we use an `unless` statement...but that is basically just an if statement, so I guess I cannot!
