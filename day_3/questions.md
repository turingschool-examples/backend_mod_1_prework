## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.  

- The conditional is a question the function checks to see if it's true or false
- `if time == 'day'`
- `if number_of_students > 30`
- `if on == true`
- `if 2 == 2`

2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
- If there are different possible branches to a function

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
name = gets.chomp
if name == "David"
   ...
end
```

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
- With `elsif` and `else` conditionals

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
```
name = gets.chomp
if name == "David"
  ...
elsif name == "Billy"
  ...
else
  ...
end
```

6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
- You can use conditionals in loops
