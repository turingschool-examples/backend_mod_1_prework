## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?  
   - A method is a way to perform an action on data. Ruby has many built in methods but also allows you to create and store your own.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.  
   ```ruby
   def hello()
     p "Sam I am"
   end
   ```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.  
   ```ruby
   def hello_someone(name)
     p "#{name} I am"
   end
   ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?  
   ```ruby
   hello_someone("Jake")
   ```

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?  
   - In the 'Common Student Questions' [here](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex21.html), I'm not sure what he's saying when he talks about ruby printing formula/functions _backwards_ or _inside out_?
