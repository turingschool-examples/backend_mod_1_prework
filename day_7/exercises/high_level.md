Add a `high_level.md` file to your day_7 directory. In that file, write up high level notes about how you would solve one of the following problems

In the caesar-cipher problem you would need to first define the caesar_cipher method and tell in "()" what arguments  and how many arguments are going to be related to this method. In this case, a string and a number. You then need to assign (define) your instance variables, in this case we assign an empty string, to leave it open to whatever string the user inputs. We then tell the program what to do when the variables is found in the input. In this problem we are telling the program to scan the index position of a string and then if the letter exist from A-Z to then include it in a lowercase. For the number argument we have to tell it how many times or loops to go through in within the string. You then have to tell the string how much to shift the characters. You then allow for the user to input a string with the get chomp method and have it return of whatever this text input is by the number of spaces to shift.
