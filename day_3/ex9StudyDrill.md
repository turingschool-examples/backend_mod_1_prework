1 - What do you think the 'if' does to the code under it?
1A - The 'if' command means that everything after it is a condition, that if true
then it print something out, but if false, then it will just move on.

2 - Why does the code under the 'if' need to be indented two spaces?
2A - I don't believe that the code needs to be indented in order to run properly.
Indenting the code after the 'if' is just so it is easier for yourself, or anyone
else to read your code.

3 - What happens if it isn't indented?
3A - Nothing, the code still runs the same.

4 - Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the 'if-statement'?
4A - Yes, as long as it is in between the 'if' and 'end' commands.

5 - What happens if you change the initial values for 'people', 'cats', and 'dogs'?
5A - If you change the initial values for 'people, 'cats' and 'dogs' the program
will just print out a different result, depending on the conditions.
