## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to take a code that might be used multiple times and put it into one place. Allowing any changes that may occur to happen in this one place - but affecting all the places that it occurs.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello(words)

  puts words

end

hello("Sam I am")

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)

  puts name

end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone(name = '"#{name} I am"')

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

I don't think that I have any right now. I had to look up \n as I wasn't super sure what that was.
