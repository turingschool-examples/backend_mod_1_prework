# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result. You should be able to run this
# file from your terminal with the command `ruby day_3/exercises/if_statements.rb`

# example, using the weather variable below, determine what you need to take
# with you to be prepared based on the following conditions:
  # if it is sunny, print "sunscreen"
  # if it is rainy, print "umbrella"
  # if it is snowy, print "coat"
  # if it is icy, print "yak traks"

  weather = 'rainy'

  if weather == 'sunny'
    p "sunscreen"
  elsif weather == 'rainy'
    p "umbrella"
  elsif weather == 'snowy'
    p "coat"
  elsif weather == 'icy'
    p "yak traks"
  else
    p "good to go!"
  end

# Manipulate the variable 'weather' to see if you can print something other
# than 'coat'
weather = 'rainy'

# Using the num_quarters variable defined below, determine
# if you have enough money to buy a gumball. A gumball costs
# two quarters. Right now, the program will print
# out both "I have enough money for a gumball" and
# "I don't have enough money for a gumball". Write
# a conditional statement that only prints one or the
# other.

# You should be able to change num_quarters and achieve these outputs:
# When num_quarters = 0, program should print "I don't have enough money for a gumball"
# When num_quarters = 1, program should print "I don't have enough money for a gumball"
# When num_quarters = 2, program should print "I have enough money for a gumball"
# When num_quarters = 3, program should print "I have enough money for a gumball"

p "How many quarters do you have?"
quarters = $stdin.gets.chomp.to_i

if quarters >= 2
p "I have enough money for a gumball"
elsif quarters <= 1
p "I don't have enough money for a gumball"

# Using the variables defined below, determine if you have the
# ingredients to make a pizza. A pizza requires at least two cups
# of flour and sauce.

# You should be able to change the variables to achieve the following outputs:
# When cups_of_flour = 1 and has_sauce = true, your program should print "I cannot make pizza"
# When cups_of_flour = 1 and has_sauce = false, your program should print "I cannot make pizza"
# When cups_of_flour = 2 and has_sauce = true, your program should print "I can make pizza"
# When cups_of_flour = 3 and has_sauce = true, your program should print "I can make pizza"
p "How many cups_of_flour do you have?"
p "Do you have_sauce (yes/no)?"

cups_of_flour = $stdin.gets.chomp.to_i

if cups_of_flour >= 1 && have_sauce = 'yes'
  p "I can make pizza!"
