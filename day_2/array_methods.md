   + Orders the array by default in ascending order. We can further specify how the array is sorted using a block right after calling sort.

   + The additional block after calling sort will utilize a comparison between two values being compared. |val1,val2| val1<=>val2 inside the block will sort from smallest to largest, while |val1,val2| val2<=>val1 will sort from largest to smallest.
