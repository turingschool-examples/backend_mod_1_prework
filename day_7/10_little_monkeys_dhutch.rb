## The following is an alternative way i wanted to try this, after reading about my peer's approaches on Slack.
## After I got it to work properly I also started having some fun with it and practicing conditionals to adjust the grammar for subject-verb agreement.


# monks = ["Zero", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten"]
#
# puts "-" * 20
#
# monks.reverse.each do |value|
#
#   if value == "One"
#     puts "#{value} little monkey jumping on the bed,"
#   else
#     puts "#{value} litte monkeys jumping on the bed,"
#   end
#
#   if value == "Zero"
#     puts "None were left to bump their heads,"
#   else
#     puts "One fell off and bumped his head,"
#   end
#
#   puts "Mama called the doctor and the doctor said,"
#
#   if value == "Zero"
#     puts "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"
#   elsif value == "One"
#     puts "Get that monkey straight to bed!"
#   else
#     puts "Get those monkeys straight to bed!"
#   end

#   puts ""

## New attempt, with user input for starting number of monkeys!

puts "-" * 20

puts "With how many monkeys would you like to start?"
print "> "

keys = $stdin.gets.to_i

puts "*" * 20
puts ""

while keys > 0 do
  if keys == 1

  else
    puts "#{keys} litte monkeys jumping on the bed,"

  if keys == 1
    puts "He fell off and bumped his head,"
  else
    puts "One fell off and bumped his head,"
  end

  if keys == 1
    puts "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"
