## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

- A conditional statement lets you use branching options so you can create behavior that can only happen if you choose the correct branch.

- I only know three and they are if/unless/and case/ when statements.`

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

*You use an if statement to check a condition and run code if its true, if it isn't you run multiple blocks of codes until you find a true statement.*

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```ruby
 if booleanExpression
    puts code if it is true.
end
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

```ruby
elsif booleanexpression1
  puts "code if true"
elsif booleanExpression2
  puts "code if 2 is true"
else shows that nothing is true.
end
  ```

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

```ruby
if booleanExpression
    puts "code if expression is true"
  elsif booleanExpression2
     puts "code if expression 2 is true and first was false"
else you find a true Statements
  puts "this will print if nothing is true"
end
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

*unless statements*
