# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:

name = "Kerri"
puts "#{name}"

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:

house_elf = "Dobby"
puts "#{house_elf}"

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:

 Hogwarts = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"

 p "#{Hogwarts}"

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:

students = 22
puts "#{students + 2}"

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:

puts "#{students - 2}"


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Rob"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 2

puts "#{first_name}"
puts "#{is_hungry}"
puts "#{number_of_pets}"


# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# For the "first_name" you would have to use a string data type as you are just assigning a proper noun to the variable.
# For is_hungry I wanted to use a boolean to denote if the variable is true or false.
# The "number_of_pets" would have to be an integer data type because you need a whole number for a value, as opposed to a float.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Michael"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 6

puts "#{first_name}"
puts "#{is_hungry}"
puts "#{number_of_pets}"

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts "#{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks}"

#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
# as you would expect? Yes!
      #Yes!  They all worked as expected!
