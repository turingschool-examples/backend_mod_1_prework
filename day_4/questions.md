## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

Methods are useful for saving lines of code that will be used later on in a program
likely multiple times thus allowing a programmer to recall that code without having
to retype it over and over.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

`def hello()
   puts "Sam I am"
 end`

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

`def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
 end`

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`hello_someone(Eric)`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

I'm not sure I have many questions but I would very much like more practice and
examples of methods in Ruby.
