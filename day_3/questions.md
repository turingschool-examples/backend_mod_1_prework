## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

#### A **conditional statement** can be used to take decisions base on certain conditions in your program.

#### 1. **If Then**
#### 2. **If Then Else**
#### 3. **If Then Else If Else**

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

#### To see one or more condition is either `true` or `false`.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

`name = Justin

if name == "Justin"
  puts "Hello Justin!"
end`


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

#### You add the `elsif` structure to the statement.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

`x = 2

if x == 2
  puts "The number is Even."
elsif x == 1
  puts "The number is Odd."
else
  puts "I don't know!"
end`

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

#### We might want to see the time range when something is going to happen, and in that case, we might want to use the **when** statement instead of the **if** statement.
