## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
  A hash sorts things via keys of any object type whereas arrays use a number index.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {"Dog Food" => 30, "Kitty Litter" => 25, "Bird Seed" => 15}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
puts states.keys[1]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
puts states.keys
puts states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
