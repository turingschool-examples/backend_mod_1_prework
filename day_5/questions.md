## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
 * A Hash is a collection of keys and their defined values. An Array is a list of ordered items, but in the Hash they are unordered.

2. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
 * pet_store = {fish: 513, bowls: 12, food: 25}

3. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
 * states["IA"]

4. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
 * states.keys
 * states.values

5. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
 * A library catalog would use a hash to have books(keys) tied to their location(values) within the library. This would be better than an array since the array can only hold and list the data, but with a hash we can assign the specific location to each specific book.

6. What questions do you still have about hashes?
 * Like most of the things I've learned so far I just want to better understand how this interacts in a real world application. I know that will come in time and with future mods.
