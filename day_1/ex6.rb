# 1. done
# 2. done
# 3. there are technically 5. twice in line 14, once in 16, and 3 times in 17 (two strings in a string in a string)
# 4. addition is the operation of combining 2 variables to become one, so it makes sense it would work the same with strings since they are also variables in this case.
# 5. They still work. My guess is that it is because they are both are used to identify their contents as strings. I thought that maybe if you used " and ' together that it wouldn't work, but it worked just the same as using all the same.
