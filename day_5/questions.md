## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?

A hash is similar to array in the fact that it stores data however a hash allows for non-numerical data to be mapped

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {turtles: 100, goldfish: 200, rabbits: 50}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

puts "#{IA}"

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?

p states.keys
p states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?

A hash would be helpful when mapping out all of the different names and details of a project you are creating. It would allow you to easily sort and change all of the different items you may have in your directory

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

My questions would be how your hashes affect the code you are writing and how it exactly works with the other commands and methods we have been learning
