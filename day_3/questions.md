## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  * Conditional statements evaluate a statement as either true or false.
    1. if ==
    1. elsif <=
    1. elsif >=

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  * To give an answer based on a condition being either true or false.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

  * if variable == value
      p "This output"
    end  

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

  * if variable == value && other_variable == other_value
      p "This output"

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

  * if variable == value
      p "This output"
    elsif variable == value_2
      p "Other output"
    end  

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

  * An if statement could be used to quickly decide if an input warrants a certain output. For example you could quickly run through a dataset of people paying tuition for a course, and see if the amount that they have paid is enough to cover the tuition.
