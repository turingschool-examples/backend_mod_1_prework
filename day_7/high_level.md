Create Caesar Cipher

1. Make an array.

 1.2. Make an array based on the 26 letters of the english alphabet, but can also
 take the `space` character

 1.3. Make sure each letter in the array is presented as a string.

2. Create a Method to modify the array

 2.1. Using the rotate method, X times shift the position of the characters in the
  alphabet string.

  2.2. Use to new modified array as a reference against the first array and save
  it as a new variable.

3. Create Cipher

 3.1. Make a new class called `CaesarCipher`.

  3.2. Make methods called `encode` for the new class which take alphabetic input and reference them
  to a shifted alphabet based on a number given by the user.

  3.3. Have the methods return a string of characters from the shifted alphabet based
   on the user's input.
