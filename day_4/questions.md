## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
  - The purpose of a method is to modify an instance of an attribute of a class

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.  
```
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end

```    

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.  
```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?  

  - You would type `hello_someone(name)` on the command line  
  - I believe you could call it with `.hello_someone(name)`.

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?  

  - Some methods are universal to ruby. Why do we need to think of methods as a way to changes an attribute to class? Could't we just think of a method as a way to accomplish a task in our code?
