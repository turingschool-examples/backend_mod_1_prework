## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
* A method is a way of creating a repeatable action within your own code. This makes iteration easier when dealing with lots of data
1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello()
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```
1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`hello_someone(sam)`
1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
* Honestly the methods make a ton a sense to me. I am strugglng a bit on how this works in practice, specifically thinking of a large application or model that ingests data and then invokes a Method seems so far off. That being said i technically haven't started class yet... So the concept is clicking well, but i am excited to see how it all sticks together.
