## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
A method can compute values and store them in local variables that are specific to the function.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello(name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
end

puts hello(Sam)

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello(name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
end

puts hello(Sam)

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
puts hello(Sam)

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
I don't feel like I have a solid grasp of methods and need more practice.
