## Day 2 Questions

#### 1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.

`a = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`

#### 2. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

```Ruby
a = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]
animals = a
```

#### 3. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

Indices in Ruby start from `0`. Therefore to access "giraffe", we need the first element. The square brackets allow to access any element of an array.

`puts animals[1]`

#### 4. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

`animals << "lion"`

#### 5. Name and describe two additional array methods.

The `select` method allows to keep certain elements of an array based on a requirement given as an input and returns the array of elements that meet the requirement.

Example:
```ruby
numbers = [2, 45, 23, 57, 78, 2, 9, 14]
numbers.select{|element| element.odd?} # returns a sub array of odd elements
```

The `push` method works like the `<<` method but allows to add several elements at the end of an array.

Example:
```ruby
numbers = [2, 45, 23, 57]
numbers.push(23).push(27) # returns the new array
```

#### 6. What are the boolean values in Ruby?

The boolean values in Ruby are `True` and `False`.

#### 7. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?

The boolean expression `2 == 25` returns `True` if `2` is equal to `25` and `False` otherwise.

#### 8. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?

The boolean expression `25 > 2` returns `True` if `25` is greater than `2` and `False` otherwise.
