#Coding the Ceasar Cipher

1. The first thing I would do is read through the given information in the markdown file
1. Next, I would create a .rb file to begin creating a program that I can test.
1. I would also begin typing out what I think may work using the octothorpe to define a comment so it doesn't run in the program.
1. As I finish reading through the markdown, we are given a hint as to what the interactive pattern is. We are probably at least using a method, maybe a class, but this cipher doesn't seem to need as much detail that a class would need.
1. I also noticed the method .encode. I will research that first to see if it is a ruby method or a class method that I need to define.
1. After internet researching, I found that .encode is an instance that allows for character encoding. This means I can use it or try with different code.
1. I tried using .encode, it was a little too confusing for me.
1. I practiced creating a cipher method, however, I kept getting error after error since I struggled to find the appropriate methods for what I was looking for. After attempting many different iterations, I began researching Ruby Caesar Cipher to see what others have done before.
1. I found a similar version that allows user input.
1. Using the code, I practiced typing by rewriting the code and trying to understand what I saw as I typed.
1. To continue best practices, I read my code backwards, comparing characters and lines to the code I got it from.
1. I ran the code using the Terminal to test it is working, and also to catch any typo errors I might have created.
1. There were no issues, the program created a cypher.
1. Since I struggled with this solution, I wrote out what each line does in English to the best of my ability.
1. This will help solidify the information and give me questions and keywords to research on my own time.
