## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
I believe the purpose of a method is to create a framework that can be applied to many different chunks of code. We would have to write out hundreds if not thousands of more lines in place of a simple method.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end

print hello

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("name")
for my example, I put hello_someone("Thomas") in which
Thomas I am was printed.

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
I don't really have any questions in particular. I have to work on my fluency as I make a lot of syntax and punctuation errors which causes my code to not work. Overall though, I think I need the most amount of work on math calling methods as I fear that will be extremely important soon enough.
