## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

+ It cuts down the amount of code you have to write to make a program work.
sometimes you have to do an operation several times and rather than write it all out,
with a method you can call it rather than write it all out. 


1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end

hello
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
`hello_someone("Sam")`

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
+ I am still a little unsure of the importance of the call stack.
