## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A Hash matches a key to a value, and the order does not matter like in an array.

2. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {crickets: 82, lizards: 24, snakes: 9}

3. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

states["IA"]

4. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

states.keys

5. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

Hashes are very useful for any type of listing, like in an inventory or supplies.  Hashes are better than arrays because the inventory value can be called from the name or key, while in an array, one needs the position in the array of the name or item.

6. What questions do you still have about hashes?

Are several nested hashes the most effective method for keeping track of more than 2 or 10 listings of values/info to be associated with each key or name?
