Common Array Methods

**.sort** --> sort contents of the array alphabetically if they are strings or ascending if they are numbers.

**.each** --> iterate through the array using each element as a parameter to perform what is requested in the block

**.collect** --> iterate though the array using each element as a parameter to alter the contents of the array. Original array not affected unless calling on.collect!

**.first** --> returns the first element located in the array (i.e. the element at index 0)

**.last** --> returns the last element located in the array

**.shuffle** --> Returns an array where the elements are no longer in the order they were created. Original array not affected unless calling on.shuffle!
