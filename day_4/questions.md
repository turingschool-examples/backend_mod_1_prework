## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
   To save time when coding. It will allow you to call on the method as many times as needed without writing it over and over.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```ruby
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```ruby
hello_someone("Diana")
```

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
None at the moment, I need to practice them more by typing some examples and analyzing the various possibilities.
