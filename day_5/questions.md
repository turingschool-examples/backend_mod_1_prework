## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
- An array is a numbered index of paired data. Hashses are unordered data where the data is linked in keys/values.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
- pet_store{dog_food: 137, cat_food: 190, bird_food: 37, misc: 999}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
- p states['Iowa']

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
- p states

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
- embedding multiple methods, strings, etc.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
- need to continue to practice.
