## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

Conditional statements are phrases that create a conditional relationship between two variables, such as

if minutes < 7
  puts "The water is not boiling yet."
elseif minutes are == 7
  puts "It's just barely boiling."
elseif minutes >= 8
  puts "It's boiling!"
else
  puts "Hot! Hot! Hot!"
end

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

I may want to use an if-statement in a situation where the program's reaction is dependent upon the user's input decision. For instance, if I want to figure out it's fall or not by whether pumpkin spice latte's are available, I'll ask the user whether they are or not, and then will say it is or isn't fall depending on their answer (PSLs = Autumn drink)

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

You must include some some sort of if/then paradigm, such as is shown in my answer to the first question.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You use the term "elsif" combined with another condition, such as shown in my answer to the first question.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

If must appear first, then elsif statements appear later, with an else statement addressing all other possibilities not addressed by earlier conditional statements. Refer to my answer to the first question for example.

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

If-statements can be a little unwieldily, so we've got unless statements or other terms that get things done more eloquently.
