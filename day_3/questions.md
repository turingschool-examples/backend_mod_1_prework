## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement is a decision point in coding. They read either "true"
or "false" as the result of a set parameter at that point. Based on that result
the code will either stop of continue. Ruby uses the statements "if", "elsif",
and "else" to achieve this. Some logical operators used are: > (greater than),
< (less than), and = (equal to).

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
You would use an if statement to decide is a set parameter is met or not. If you
want your code to continue until a certain data point is reached for example
you would use an if-statement to achieve that.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
If statement are coded in the following manner:

if x (conditional) < (logical operator) y (conditional)
puts "Enter your desired output here."


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
You can add multiple conditions to an if statement by continuing to put
conditions under "elsif" and when you reach your final you can use "else".

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
x = 1
if x < 1
puts "Thats less than 1!"
elsif x == 1
puts "That equals 1!"
else x > 1
puts "Thats more than 1!"
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
A conditional statement can be used for a comparison. The result of that
would be the boolean operators "true" or "false".
