##CeasarCipher

```
plain:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
cipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
```

Create a file named caesar_cipher.rb and within that file, write a program that will take any string, and encode it based on a shift value provided by the user.  The interaction pattern for this program might look something like this:

```
cipher = CeasarCipher.new
cipher.encode("Hello World", 5)
=> "CZGGJ RJMGY"
```
