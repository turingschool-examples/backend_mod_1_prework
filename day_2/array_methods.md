## Array Methods

* sort - sorts the elements in alphabetical order if they are strings and ascending order if they're numbers
* each - iterates over each of the elements
* collect - takes each element and transforms them into something else, thus creating a new array
* first - returns the first element
* last - returns the last element
* shuffle - shuffles the elements position in the array
