## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?

A hash is a collection of keys that have values, in no particular order, while an array is a collection of items in a particular order.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {food_brands: 14, cat_toys: 135, training_tools: 35}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?

states.keys
states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?

Clothes in the closet. You'd want to have the number of types of clothes, not just the different types of clothes.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

None.
