## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.<br>
it is a logical comparison that evaluates to true or false<br>
 "<= less than or equal"<br>
 ">= greater than or equal"<br>
 "> greater than"
2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?<br>
when you are sure of the input of variables and want to write what to do in several scenarios.
3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement? <br>
if <br>
elsif <br>
end
4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?<br>
elsif
5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?<br>

end

6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?<br>
We might use if-Statements for comparison of limits/capacity, will this input or procedure exceed what is available or for user input: if the number is too great or too small, then ask again.
