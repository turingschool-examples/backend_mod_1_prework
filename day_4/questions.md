## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?  
The purpose of a method is to create a code block that we can use multiple times in our program which performs an action or returns a value based on different inputs. Without methods, we would have to rewrite the same code block every time we wanted to perform a specific action with different inputs, which would become very tedious. In addition, a method is also useful because you can nest methods as inputs within other methods, which becomes a very powerful tool and allows for complex calculations.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.  
```
def hello  
    p "Sam I am"  
 end
 ```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.  
```
def hello_someone(name)
    p "#{name} I am"
 end
 ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
`hello_someone("Antonio")` with anyone's name within the parenthesis and quotes

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?  
I don't have any additional questions about methods in Ruby at this time. Thank you!
