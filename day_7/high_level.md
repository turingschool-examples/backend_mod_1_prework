### 10 Little monkeys breake down!!

For 10_little_monkeys I would use a ryhme as my class and the 10_little_monkeys as my instance of. I would then use the attributes of a ryhme as being a protagonist and an antagonist then I would create methods that would move the ryhme along. this could get more specific depending on the instance of the specific Ryhme. Finally I would print the words to the ryhme with the instance variables and my specific methods in it so that you could change the components by effecting the attributes.

1. 10 little monkeys
1.1 amount of monkeys on bed
1.1.1 how many monkeys are seen
1.1.1.1 what happens to one of the monkeys that falls off the bed.  
1.2 momma monkey
1.2.1 what momma does when she sees monkeys jumping on the bed
1.3 doctor monkey
1.3.1 what does the doctor monkey say when momma monkey calls


Next I am going to work on the Fizzbuzz. project.

Looking at the program I think that I would like for it to be an if else statment. I would put in that if a number is a multiple of 3 then it would print fizz and if it was a multiple of 5 then it would print buzz and so on. starting with the if being what to do if the number is a multiple of three or five then elsif if it is a multiple of three then finally an else for if it is not any of them. I do not think that I would actually make a class for this but I will play around with it.

1. fizzbuzz
1.1 multiple of 3 or 5
1.1.1 print Fizzbuzz
1.2 multiple of 5
1.2.1 print Buzz
1.3 multiple of 3
1.3.1 print Fizz
1.4 all other numbers
1.4.1 P just the number.
