## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

One thing that resonated with me is how much truly goes into being a 'SuperLearner'. It will definitely take a lot of work in order to change myself from where I am now to being a 'SuperLearner'. That being said I already do steps 2, 3, and 5. Step 4 I also do as much as I can. However, steps 1 and 6 I am going to have to do far more often. I would also add that SuperLearners need to have an excellent work ethic and a lot of personal discipline. They also would need to procrastinate much less than the average person.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

The first string method is .length and it tells you how many characters are in a string, including spaces.

The second string method is .split and it splits your sting into sections based on the added argument. If no argument is added it will split it up by spaces.
