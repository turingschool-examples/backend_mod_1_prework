## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

    Methods are like variables that take in complex directions that you can manipulate data with.
  They help you save time from having to rewrite redundant code and enable you to package code
  into less bulky, less sloppy pieces, leaving your code to be easier to read.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  def hello
    p "Sam I am"
  end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
  def hello_someone(name)
    print "#{name} I am."
  end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

  hello_someone("Mary")
