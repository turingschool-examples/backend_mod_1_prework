# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."


# STUDY DRILLS
# 1. I was correct with the pound sign in thinking it is for note taking and in some cases disabling code
# 2. I took this file and reviewed every line backwards
# 3. I found one mistake and fixed it
# 4. I read this file out loud and found no further mistakes. However I will keep this in mind for future use
