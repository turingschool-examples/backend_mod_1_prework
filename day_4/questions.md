## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

Methods allow us to group one or more statements into a single unit so we don't have to repeat it over and over.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
 
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end

hello

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Sam")

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
Just how to put these methods into practical use, which I'm sure we will get into in future mods.
