# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_1/exercises/numbers.rb`

# Example: Write code that prints the result of the sum of 2 and 2:
p 2 + 2

# Write code that prints the result of 7 subtracted from 83:
p 83 - 7

# Write code that prints the result of 6 multiplied by 53:
p 6 * 53

# Write code that prints the result of the modulo of 10 into 54:
num1 = 54
num2 = 10
p num1.modulo(num2)
# or
puts 54 % 10


# i have literally never encountered the term "modulo" in all of my math classes, highschool, college, or even this class. Certainly not in any of the previous guides to numbers and doing equations in ruby. 
# side note, I found something that explained that % is the modulo symbol. It would probably be a good idea to update the guid that you had us use to mention that, as there is currently ZERO mention of the word "modulo" up until this point.
# i am incredibly unimpressed by the existence of modulo. what good could knowing the remainder possibly be? We stopped doing division using remainder instead of decimals in like what, 1st or 2nd grade? looking forward to finding out why we use this.
