#Pre-Work Reflections

**1. What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?**

```
I believe myself to be a very empathetic person. I think it has helped me in building everlasting friendships and great bonds with work colleagues. People trust me because they know I care about the people I surround myself with. It has also helped me be a good soon-to-be husband to my soon-to-be wife. I always listen with empathy in hopes to improve myself in our relationship.

As far as in the professional world, empathy helped me be a better teacher. Understanding what specific problems students are having by getting to know them, and getting them to trust that I have the best intentions for them is what made me such a strong teacher. I always listened to what they had to say. To me, having empathy is one of the most important skills a human can have.

**2. How does empathy help you build better software?**

```
Empathy can help build better software because it can allow you to understand how to make it better. In order to make better software, you must have feedback and compile research on the current software and the people that use it. If you do research with the intention of really listening to the people who use a product, it will make you more understanding of what the product/software needs. Additionally, it will better the lives of the people involved, which is what we strive for.

**3. Why is empathy important for working on a team?**

```
Empathy is crucial for being a good team member. Listening to others and being able to take their feedback in order to become a better teammate is the key to a strong team. Making sure that others feel heard is important as well. If you take what you've learned while actively listening to a team member and use it appropriately, it will let them know that you care. In all, having empathy in the workplace is crucial to a successful team.

**4. Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.**

```
I recently had a student who was struggling with a math problem. I explained and tried to demonstrate how to find the equation of a circle on a graph, but it wasn't clicking for her. She said she didn't understand what all of the different letters meant and how they related to a circle. I then took a new route and tried to explain it to her with diagrams. I showed her how the equation of a circle related directly to right triangles and the pythagorean theorem, and that's when it clicked for her. I used empathy by listening to what she was struggling with and then changing my teaching technique to meet the student's needs.
```

**5. When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios?**

```
It is hardest to be empathic in a professional setting when you're working with someone who is stubborn or unwilling to listen. Being such an empathic person myself, I have trouble working with people who are selfish. I'm always trying to find win-win scenarios and love sharing successes with others, so I don't relate as well to those who don't share that perspective. To improve upon that when faced with the scenario, I think I need to spend more time getting to know my team member and what makes them the way they are. Sometimes peeling the layers back on a person can help you relate better. And lastly, performing an act for a teammate can show them that you care and help build a bond of empathy between the team.
