## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to create a block of code that can work as a useful tool in the rest of your code if you need to repeat one task on multiple pieces of code.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

hello

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
hello_someone("RobBoss")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
How do we use methods in everyday coding? What is the most common uses of methods? I'm interested in seeing what a complex method would look like and how they are implemented as well.
