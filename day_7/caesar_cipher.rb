# I utilized this a lot when writing my high_level.md file. What I
# did was comment out each line to comprehend what the line did
# in relation to the code. I then ran this code in my terminal
# to see the result. This was incredibly helpful in gaining a
# very basic comprehension how this code was created. I have an
# understanding that there are multiple ways to create a cipher.

# This was another website that I referenced for understanding.
