#Also known as a shift cipher, the Ceasar Cipher is one of the
#oldest and simplest encoding techniques.  A Ceasar Cipher works
#by shifting the alphabet by a set number of letters down the
#alphabet.  For example, with a left shift of 3, 'D' would be
#replaced by 'A', 'E' would be replaced by 'B', and so on.
#See below for a full alphabet example with a left shift of 3:

#```
#plain:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
#cipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
#```

#Create a file named caesar_cipher.rb and within that file, write a program that will take any string, and encode it based on a shift value provided by the user.  The interaction pattern for this program might look something like this:

#```
#cipher = CeasarCipher.new
#cipher.encode("Hello World", 5)
#=> "CZGGJ RJMGY"
#```
