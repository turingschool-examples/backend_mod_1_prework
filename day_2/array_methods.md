Common Array Methods

1. sort - orders the elements in an array following rules defined by ruby for this method.  I don't know them all, but in general, capital letters come before lowercase letters, numbers return before letters, numbers appear in ascending order and letters return in alphabetic order.

2. each - iterates each element of an array and when used with a block, returns each element with whatever the block says to do to each element. It's loop of instructions that uses each element in an array, one at a time, until it runs out of elements.

3. index - finds the address of an element in an array; if it is not present returns nil.

4. include? - asks if an element is present. Returns true if it is present or false if it is not present.

5. first - returns the first element in an array.

6. last - returns the last element in an array.
