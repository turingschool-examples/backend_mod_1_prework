## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement is one sets up a dependency on something being checked and makes a decision based on the dependent variable.

If I pass the Turing program I'll get a software development job
If I don't have coffee I probably won't pass the Turing program.
Anything else than passing Turing on my first try will result in questioned looks from my friends and family ("But you're great at computers!")

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
Well, if you wanted to have a program end in more than one single way EVERY TIME then I guess you'll have to use some decisions....

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if (condition) (block) followed by an else or elsif with the same format, then end.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
Using elsif statements with their own conditions.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
