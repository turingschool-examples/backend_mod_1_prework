# Day 5 - Hashes

Earlier in the week, you learned about one type of collection storage - Arrays.  Today, you will learn about another collection storage device called a Hash. As professional developers, you will use hashes on a near daily basis- a solid understanding of how to build hashes and how to retrieve information from them will make life much easier.

When you are all done with the lessons, exercises, and questions for today, you will once again use git to save your work locally, and then send your work to Github.

## Open your local copy of backend_module_0_capstone

Using your terminal, open your local copy of the forked repository you created during setup. Hopefully you are getting the hang of this, but revisit [day_1](../day_1) for more detail if needed.

## Hash Lessons

1. Work through the following lessons. Any files that you create while working can be kept in today's `exercises` directory. 

    - [ ] [Hashes](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex39.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [ ] [Hashes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#8.-hashes) from Ruby in 100 minutes.

1. Work through the hashes.rb file in the day_5/exercises directory.

1. Answer the questions in the questions.md file in the day_5 directory.

## Save your work in Git

When you are finished with all of the day_5 activities, enter the following commands in your terminal in order to save your work to your local git repository:

1. `$ git add day_5/exercises`
1. `$ git add day_5/questions.md`
1. Use `git add day_5/<filename>` to add all additional files that you created today
1. `$ git status` - you should see only green filenames - if you see any that are red, continue to `git add` those files until `git status` shows all green files.
1. `$ git commit -m "Add Day 5 Work"`

## Push to Github

Remember- You've saved your work to git on your **local** machine, but it is not yet accessible through your **remote** Github repository. Push your code up to Github with the following command:

```
git push origin master
```

You should now be able to log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote prework repository and see all the work you did today!
