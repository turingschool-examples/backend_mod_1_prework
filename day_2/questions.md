## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.

**animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]**

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

**Already done in prior question. animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]**

1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

**puts animals[1]** *because giraffe is indexed at [1]*

1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

**animals << "lion"**

1. Name and describe two additional array methods:

**Sort** *is a method that alphabetizes all elements of an array if the elements are strings. If the elements are numbers, it will organize them in ascending numberical order.*

**Each** *is a method that creates an iteration through each element in the array.*

1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?

**&&(and), ||(or), !(not), !=(not equal), ==(equal), >=(greater than or equal to), and <=(less than or equal to)**

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?

**2 == 25**

*The result is* **false** *because 2 does not equal 25*

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?

**25 >= 2**

*The result is* **true** *because 25 is greater than 2*
