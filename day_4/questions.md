## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

Calling a piece of code that we need over and over instead of typing it all every time.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```Ruby
def hello
  p "Sam I Am"
end
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```Ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

```Ruby
hello_someone("Rene")
```

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
None that I can think of right now.
