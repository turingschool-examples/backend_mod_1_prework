# Day 6 - Classes

Today, you are going to be learning about Objects and Classes. In ruby, Classes are one of the tools we use to group together specific Methods that are meant to work together, or on the same type of Object. Arriving at Turing with a strong understanding of how to build a class, and how to call Methods on that class will make your first couple of weeks go smoothly!

When you are all done with the lessons, exercises, and questions for today, you will once again use git to save your work, and then put it in the cloud on Github.

## Open your local copy of backend_module_0_capstone
Using your terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the prework repository. If you are having trouble with this, see the day_1 instructions.

1. Work through the [What Are Objects](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/the_object_model#whatareobjects) and [Classes Defining Objects](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/the_object_model#classesdefineobjects) sections of the Object Model Lesson from LaunchSchool. Any files that you create while working through this lesson can be kept in the day_6 directory.

1. Work through the [Classes and Objects Part 1](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/classes_and_objects_part1) lesson from LaunchSchool.

1. Work through the [Objects, Attributes and Methods](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#11.-objects,-attributes,-and-methods) lesson from Ruby in 100 Minutes. Any files that you create while working through this lesson can be kept in the day_6 directory.

1. Work through the files in the day_6/exercises directory.

1. Answer the questions in the questions.md file in the day_6 directory.

## Save your work in Git

When you are finished with all of the day_6 activities, use your terminal to run the following commands in order to save your work to your local git repository.

1. `$ git add day_6/exercises`
1. `$ git add day_6/questions.md`
1. Use `git add day_6/<filename>` to add all additional files that you created today
1. `$ git status` - you should see only green filenames - if you see any that are red, continue to `git add` those files until `git status` shows all green files.
1. `$ git commit -m "Add Day 6 Work"`

## Push to Github

You've save your work to git on your **local** machine, but it is not yet accessible through your **remote** Github repository. Updating our **remote** Github repository with our **local** changes is called **pushing**. Push your code with the following command:

```
git push origin master
```

You should now be able to log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote prework repository and see all the work you did today!
