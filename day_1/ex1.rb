# STUDY DRILLS

# Make your script print another line.
puts "Please print another line."

# Make your script print only one of the lines.
# puts "Hello World!"
# puts "Hello Again"
# puts "I like typing this."
# puts "This is fun."
puts "Yay! Printing."
# puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
# puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'

# Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
puts "Hello World!"
# puts "Hello Again"
puts "I like typing this."
puts "This is fun."
puts "Yay! Printing."
puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'
# The octothorpe appears to mark that line as commentary, not code to run!
