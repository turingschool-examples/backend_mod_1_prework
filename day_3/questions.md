## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

if a > c
  puts "a is greater than c"
elsif a < c
  puts "a is less than c"
else
  puts "a is neither less than or greater to c"

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

To give various outputs based on certain conditions being met or not. For example, if one number is greater than or equal to another number, then run this code block. If it's not, then run this code block.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if (conditional statement)
  (run this block of code)
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

By adding an elsif and/or else after the if statement but before the word end. For example:

if (conditional statement)
  (run this block of code)
  elsif (different conditional statement)
    (run this block of code)
  else
  (run this block of code)
end

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

if (conditional statement)
  (run this block of code)
  elsif (different conditional statement)
    (run this block of code)
  else
  (run this block of code)
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

I have spent a bit of time googling to try and find other use cases for conditional statements. At least from what I could find, the vast majority are used for if-statements. I am not sure what other reasons we might use a conditional statement.
