## Day 3 Questions

#### What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement is a piece of code that executes only when specified boolean criteria is met.  
For example:  
- If the sky is blue, then it is sunny  
- if x > 5, then add 2 to x  
- while repeat == true, continue to loop this program.  

#### Why might you want to use an if-statement?
When you might want different code to execute depending on the user response.

#### What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
if [boolean statement] (e.g. x == 2)  
 [code to perform if boolean statement is true]  
 elsif [boolean_statement2]    
  [code to perform if boolean_statement2 is true]  
 elsif [boolean_statment3]   
  [code to perform if boolean_statment3 is true]  
 else  
  [code to perform if none of above criteria are true]    
end  

#### How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
see above.

#### Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
while loops or for loops (loops that repeat indefinitely until a criteria is met)
