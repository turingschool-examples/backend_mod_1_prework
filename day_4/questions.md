## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to establish a way to perform a piece of code many times. This allows you to change something in a method that will effect all instances of that method, rather than having to change each instance individually

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.\

def hello(words)
  puts words
end

hello("Sam I am")

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Sienna")

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

No questions at the moment! What a cool tool for variable manipulation.
