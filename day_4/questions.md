## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
To create convenient, pre-written code that can be used in many places throughout a program.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello()
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
To run, call, or execute (all the same) a method, you would just type in the name and the input the arguments if there are any.
`hello()` (parenthesis optional)
`hello_someone("Ryan")`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
None at this time.
