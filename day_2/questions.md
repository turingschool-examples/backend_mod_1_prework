## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
```
animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]
```


1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.
`see above`

1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
`p animals[1]`


1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
`animals.push("Lion")`

1. Name and describe two additional array methods:
 - Again, I really like keeping track of the length of things I.E `animals.length`
 - Removing specific indexes of arrays can be handy as well I.E `animals.pop(n)`
  *with n being any number to return*

1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?
 - Boolean values represent singular bit states, either 1 or 0, true or false

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
`2 == 25` is `false`
`2 != 25` is `true`


1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
`25 > 2` is `true`
