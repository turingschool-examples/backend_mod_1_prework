## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

 A method lets us bundle up and name pieces of code so they can be re-used. They abstract the functionality of smaller pieces of code that may be used often.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

 `1| def hello`

 `2||| p "Sam I am"`

 `3| end`

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

  `1| def hello_someone(name)`

  `2||| p "#{name} I am"`

  `3| end`

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

 `4| hello_someone("AJ")`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

  I'm just taking in the information right now, I need more time to think of questions.
