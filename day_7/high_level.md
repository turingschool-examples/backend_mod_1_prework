## Caesar Cipher

- My first step would be to obtain more information on what the Caesar Cipher is and how it works, so I began with a simple google search.

- During my search I came to know that this is also known as the substitution cipher, an encryption technique.

- If we want this to be user interactive we would start off with a `get.chomp` and allow the user to enter a word or phrase.

- We also want the sure to input a shift number, so we would use a `gets.chomp` on the second step as well.

- I would want to look for a way to go through each letter like an iteration method, to do that I would need to convert my user input into an array.

- Since we can't add a number to a letter I think I'll need to find a way to convert my letters to number and then back.

- Once we add the letter to the number we will need to convert the number to the letter.
