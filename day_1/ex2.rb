# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run"

#Study_Drills
# 1. [X]I was right about what an octothorpe does.
# 2. [X] I did review each line going backwark. Starting at the last line
        #and checking each work in reverse aginst what I should have typed. I
        #and I realized that I had made typos, which I fixed.
# 3. [X] Fixed typos
# 4. [X] Read outloud, saying each character by name. I did find more mistakes
        #and fixed them. I also already had created an organized list of symbols
        #for characters so that I could learn the vocabulary. I did this at the
        #beginning of mod0 when we were introduced to shortkeys.

#Student_Questions
# 1. [X]I prefer octothorpe
# 2. [X]Symbols w/i strings are printed unless before a variable
# 3. [X]To comment out multiple lines an octothorpe is needed in the beginning of
        #each line. You can also do this outside of a string or integer, float etc.
# 4. [X]My country has octothorpes on our keyboards
# 5. [X]Reading code backwards is a simle effective trick to find writing errors
        #in code.
