# Array Methods
The 'sort' method will return a new array after it has sorted itself alphabetically.

The 'each' method will allow you to iterate through each element of an array individually.

The 'join' method will mash all of the elements of an array into one string.

The 'index' method allows us to type in a query, if there's a match, it will display the index at which it is located.

The 'include?' method allows us to ask if a specified element is present in an array.

The 'collect' method creates a new array with additions that can be specified for iterations of each element of an array.

The 'first' and 'last' methods return the first and last elements of an array respectively.

The 'shuffle' method returns a new array with the same elements of the previous array shuffled to be in a new order.
