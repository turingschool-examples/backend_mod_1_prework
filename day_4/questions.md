## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?  

The purpose of a method is to create code that will be executed many times in
a program rather than rewriting it over and over again.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```ruby
def hello(name)
  puts name
end

hello("Sam I am")
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?  

hello_someone("<insert name here"), example: hello_someone("Garret")

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?  

I don't have a particular question but I definitely need more experience with
different examples of methods. The math example in the methods and returns exercise
took me a while to grasp so I think that area is what I need to focus on.
