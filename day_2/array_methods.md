Array Methods

::[]

#<<
  Adds the given object or array to the end of an array.
#[]
  Returns the value of an index, the values of a range given, and nil if the index or start of a range of indices is out of range of the array.
#collect
  Iterates through all the elements in an Array one time, executes the given block on each element and returns a new array filled with the new value generated by the block.
#each
  Allows us to iterate through all of the elements in an Array and issue commands to them.
#first
  Returns the element in the first position of the Array.
#include?
  You can use this method to ask the Array if an element inside of it. Returns true if it is or false if it isn't.
#index
  You can ask the Array what the specific position of an element is by name or by giving a block. The block iterates through all the elements of the Array until it returns a value of true. If there isn't any element that matches the parameters of the given block it returns nill.
#join
  Turns all the elements of an array into strings and "strings" them together.
#last
  Returns the element in the last position of the Array.
#shuffle
  Scrambles the order of the elements within the Array and returns that as a new array.
#sort
  If the Array is filled with strings or numbers you can reorganize them using this method and some parameters.
