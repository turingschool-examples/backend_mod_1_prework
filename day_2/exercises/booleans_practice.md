### Exercise 28: Boolean Practice

Take each of these logic problems and write what you think the answer will be. In each case it will be either true or false. Once you have the answers written down, you will start Ruby in your terminal and type each logic problem in to confirm your answers.

true && true = true
false && true = ~~true~~ FALSE
1 == 1 && 2 == 1 = ~~true~~ FALSE
"test" == "test" = true
1 == 1 || 2 != 1 = true
true && 1 == 1 = true
false && 0 != 0 = false
true || 1 == 1 = true
"test" == "testing" = false
1 != 0 && 2 == 1 = ~~true~~ FALSE
"test" != "testing" = true
"test" == 1 = false
!(true && false) = ~~false~~ TRUE
!(1 == 1 && 0 != 1) = false
!(10 == 1 || 1000 == 1000) = false
!(1 != 10 || 3 == 4) = false
!("testing" == "testing" && "Zed" == "Cool Guy") = ~~false~~ TRUE
1 == 1 && (!("testing" == 1 || 1 == 0)) = true
"chunky" == "bacon" && (!( 3 == 4 || 3 == 3)) = false
3 == 3 && (!("testing" == "testing" || "Ruby" == "Fun")) = ~~true~~ FALSE
