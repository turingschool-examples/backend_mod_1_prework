## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
- In Ruby a conditional statement uses if or else to determine if a return is true or false and based on that return to take a certain action.
```
1st example
if x > 1
 puts "Do something"

2nd example
elsif x == 1
  puts "Do a different thing"

3rd example
else x < 1
  puts "Now do something completely different"
```


1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
- You want to use an `if-statement` when you're expecting different outputs and want to take a different action based on the output.


1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
- The Ruby syntax for an `if-statement` would start with `if` then `elsif` and the last statement would start with `else`.


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
- You add multiple conditions to an `if-statement` by using `elsif`.

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
- Below is an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement.
```ruby
if
  puts
elsif
  puts
else
  puts

```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
- If we wanted to use a conditional statement without using an if-statement, we could use `==` to check for true or false. Ruby recognizes `==` as a way to check for true or false.
