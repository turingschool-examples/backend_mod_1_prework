## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

Conditional statements are statements which are either true or false.

For example: `7 == 6` false, `7 > 6` true, `7 < 6` false.

The proper if syntax is

`if (condition)
#code block goes here

Multiple conditions are added to an if statement by way of the `elsif` and `else`
syntax these add conditions for the computer to check if the first `if` statement
is not met.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

the syntax for if/elsif/else is
`if (condition)

elsif
#code here

Other than making if statements conditionals could be effective in determining if two
given objects match each other or if objects are present in an array.
