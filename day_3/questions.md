## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  A conditional statement says that something is either true or false based on the conditions given.
    example: 1.

    animals = 3

     if animals <= 3 <-----this is the condition
        p "Yay, not too many animals to feed!"

     elsif animals > 3 <------- this is also a condition
        p "Eek! Too many animals to feed!"

    end

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
    When expecting input, the input may change the outcomes, therefore you want
    conditions/parameters set to guide the outcome expectations.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

    if conditional statement [then...]
      p code goes here
    end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
    You can use if, elsif, and else--- that gives you three different conditional statements

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

    if conditional [then...]
    p code goes here

    elsif conditional [then...]
    p code goes here

    else
    p code goes here
end


1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
    Based on what I read, if statements are used to help conditional flow of data-- it looks like using comparisons with boolean value can also assist with conditional flow Ref: (https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/flow_control)
