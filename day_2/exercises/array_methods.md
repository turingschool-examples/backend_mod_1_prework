#Arrays

##Definition
1. ***array*** is a number-indexed list. Each element in the array hold a position with the first one starting at 0.
      * the array was created by putting pieces of data between square brackets ([]) and separated by commas
      * we add an element to the end of an array by using the "shovel operator" (<<)
      * we fetch the element at a specific position by using square brackets ([])
      * there are convenience methods like .last we can use on the array
1. ***hashes*** is an unordered collection where the data is organized into "key/value pairs." Like as to assign an amount of somethings to a variable, but still in an array. 


##Common Array Methods

1.  ***.each***  iterates through each element.

1.  ***.join*** mashes elements together into one string.

1.  ***.index*** find the address of specific element.

1.  ***.include?*** asks if an element is present in the array.

1.  ***.collect*** collect will do something to change elements in array and returns the changed answers. .each will give the original array.

1.  ***.first and .last*** will print the element in the first/last position.

1.  ***.shuffle*** will shuffle the order of the array.
