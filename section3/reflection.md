## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
>Understanding mistakes and seeking out challengers really resonated with how I tackle most of my problems

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
>As stated in the first question I like to understand my mistakes and seek out new challenges to help increase my mastery. I do have an issue for asking for help but am working to remind myself that it's okay to ask for help.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
>A hash is a collection of pairs of information while both are collections used to retrieve data. Arrays is just a list while hashes has a key connected to a value.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```Ruby
pet_store = {
  dog_food_brands: 'Purina', 'Pedigree', 'Hill`s Science Diet', 'Royal Canin',
  cat_food_brands: 'Purina ONE', 'Blue Buffalo', 'Fromm', 'Wellness Complete Health,',
  kittens_for_adoption: '12',
  grooming_open: true
  }
  ```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`states["IA"]`
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`states.keys
states.values`
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
>Whenever we need to associate data values with one another. It's faster and more efficient at searching/pulling information.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
>None at the moment.
