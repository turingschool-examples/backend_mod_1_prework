### Caesar Cipher ###

#####I chose to try and work through building a caesar cipher. Here is a step-by-step of my process:#####

1. First thing to do is read the instructions given to me thoroughly. Sometimes, the answer to your simplest problems come right from the source, so I *always* keep the instructions ready.

2. Next thing I do is try and work through the problem myself. Theres a lot of methods that I don't quite know yet, but if I can work through with what I already know, I tend to create a better base for when I *do* need to start querying google.

3. Next, I go to google and search 'caesar cipher ruby' and read through trusted websites, such as ruby-docs and stack overflow. If I can find a sample code for the caesar cipher, I'll have a better understanding of the methods used.

4. Error codes are my friend, so trial and error through this process is important. No need to be afraid to fail, as long as I can decipher error codes using my brain (and google).

5. Lastly, if I'm still stuck, I tend to write on forums such as stack overflow or (in our case at turing) go to my slack and find post for the rest of my fellow students. Utilizing human resources is key.
