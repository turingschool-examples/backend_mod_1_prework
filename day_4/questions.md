## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
   * A method is a way to define one or more actions to take that can be called upon later anywhere in the code. It gives you the ability to create a single or repeatable action to take, without having to write the code over and over again by just calling upon the method.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```ruby
def hello(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

hello("Sam")
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
`hello_someone("Sam")`

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
  * I think I have a decent understanding. Will definitely take a lot more practice to really drill it in and all of the ways it can be used.
