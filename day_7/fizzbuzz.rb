# it took me so long to remember that modulo existed that I feel very ashamed. The irony is especially thick as I remember when first learning about modulars, I was curious how they could possibly be useful. My shortsightedness became my undoing as it was exactly what I needed to solve this problem.
# The above code will work with any range of numbers. I could also do fizzbuzz = (gets.chomp.to_i..gets.chomp.to_i) to allow the user to pick the range.
