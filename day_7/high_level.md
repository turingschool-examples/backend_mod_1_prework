Choosing to do the caesar_cipherser cipher it would have to be done the following way.

First the program would have to ask the user to input desired text.
Then the program would have to ask the user for the desired number by which they wish to shift the text over.

After that input is received the program would then have to create an iteration, this is done so that a shift can be applied to each letter individually.
It would do this by assigning a shift of "a" becomes "b" and also "z" becomes "a".
Both shifts have to be done so that when "z" is entered the program knows to go back to the beginning of the alphabet and start back at "a".
Once the shift is assigned, the user inputed number can then be used to tell the iteration how many letters down to shift each letter. Once this is done the new word is then printed for the user to see.
