## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
The purpose of a method is to have a block of code that will be used multiply times and have the ability to call upon it and use that block of code without having to retype that block each time you use it.
1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello()
  p "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```
friend = "John"
hello_someone(friend)
```

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
I do not have any questions about methods.
