 The first thing I would do is create a method to make the checker board with "size" being the only argument. Next, I would make an empty array that would eventually become the board. I would print out a question, outside of the method, to ask for input and then get the input and convert it to an integer. I would write an if statement to determine if the input was lower than 2 and return false if it is. After that, I would write an else that assigns a new local variable, count, to size. Finally, I would start on my while loop to make the board. The conditional statements for the while loop check if count is less than or equal to size and if it is greater than 0. The loop contains an if statement and an else statement which add to the board until it is complete. The if statement would use '%' operator to check if count is even. The code in the if and else statement are about the same. First, there is a variable created that makes up the checkerboard rows with a string and a few calculations. Next, that variable is added to the checkerboard array created at the start. The last step is to subtract 1 from count, but you can also start at 0 and count upwards. Adding to count instead. The else statement is identical besides one detail, a space in front of the X in the string instead of behind it. The checkerboard array is printed out before the end of the method, and then the method is called after the 'end'.
