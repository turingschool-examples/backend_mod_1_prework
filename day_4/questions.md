## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to save time and energy by defining a method (action of series of actions) so you can use the method name in code instead of retyping the same actions over and over.

2. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

'''Ruby
def hello(text= "Sam I am.")
  p text
end
'''

3. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

'''Ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am."
end
'''

4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

'''Ruby
hello_someone("Kyle")
'''

5. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

I don't understand how to return accurate math results in ruby, it doesn't use decimal places.  I also think I just need to practice and try things out.  What has been presented is clear, but as I try new things, I do run across snags.  Maybe i just need experience......
