Array
-way to sort data and variables in Ruby

Create arrays by putting variables into brackets:
    sports = ["fishing", "hiking", "tennis", "kayaking", "climbing"]

  To add a variable to the end of an array we input:
    sports << "skiing"

  To output a specific variable in the array:
    sports[n]      #n=whichever variable in the line you want to output

  To output the last/first variable in the array:
    sports.last      sports.first

  To sort the array in many different ways you can use .sort
    .sort will sort strings in alphabetical order and integers in descending.

  To combine the array into one string use .join

  To do something to every element of an array use .each

  To find the address of a variable by using .index

  To see if a variable is included with .include? ""
