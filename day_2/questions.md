## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.

    `["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

    `animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`

1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

    `animals[1]`

1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

1. Name and describe two additional array methods:
    
    **.pop** - the pop method removes the last item in a array and returns that item

    boolean values are logic values that are evaluated to either *true* or *false*

    ```

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
