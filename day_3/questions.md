## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

    Conditional statements are statements that can evaluate to either true or false. They are typically made up of conditional operators.

    Examples:
    - `x > 1 && x < 0`
    - `answer == true`
    - `array.include?(34)`

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

    To execute code only based on certain conditions. This is a way to make decisions with code.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

    ```ruby
    if conditional statement
      some code
    elsif other conditional statement (this is optional)
      some code
    else (this is optional)
      some code
    end
    ```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

    Multiple conditions can be added to an if statement by either adding combinations of conditions using the `&&` or `||` conditional operators or adding separate elsif statements.

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

    ```ruby
    if mood == 'happy'
      puts "Yay!"
    elsif mood == 'sad'
      puts "Awe"
    else
      puts "meh"
    end
    ```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

    Anytime we would like to make a decision in code. For example in a while loop.
