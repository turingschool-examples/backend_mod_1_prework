# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_5/exercises/hashes.rb`

# Example: Write code that prints a hash holding grocery store inventory:
foods = {apples: 23, grapes: 507, eggs: 48}
puts "there are #{foods} in the inventory."

# Write code that prints a hash holding zoo animal inventory:
zoo = {zebras: 23, lions: 56, tigers: 213}
p zoo

# Write code that prints all of the 'keys' of the zoo variable
# you created above:??
zoo.keys

# Write code that prints all of the 'values' of the zoo variable
# you created above:
zoo.values

# Write code that prints the value of the first animal of the zoo variable
# you created above:
zoo["zebras"]

# Write code that adds an animal to the zoo hash.
# Then, print the updated hash:
zoo{bears}

p zoo
