### Ceasar_cipher project

My plan with the ceasar_cipher project is to create a class called CeasarCipher and then break it down with attributes then use those attributes and write a method that effects those attributes to change.

1. Ceasar_cipher
1.1 message
1.1.1 any string
1.2 number to be shifted
1.2.1 inputed number by user
1.3 encode
1.3.1 new string output.

### Checker_board project

My plan for this project is to create a Checker_board class and give it a size attribute. Then we will write a method that takes the input of size then produces a checker_board.

1. checker_board
1.1 size
1.2 renber the board.
