## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  *A conditional statement is an if-then statement. If what follows the if condition is true, then there is a resulting effect (then statement).
  - If you eat your vegetables, then you may have dessert.
  - If it's warm outside, then it is acceptable to wear shorts.
  - If the number of coronavirus cases decreases, then society will go back to operating as normal.*

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  *An if statement would be used in order to logic through a variety of situations, each with a different result. It presents the results that are only applicable to the selected conditional statement.*

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
*if (conditional)
  - block
else
  - block_2*

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
*Multiple conditions are added to an if statement using 'elsif'.*

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
*if sheep_wool > 4
  puts "It's time to sheer these sheep!"
elsif sheep_wool < 4 && sheep_wool >= 2
  puts "It's not yet time to sheer the sheep."
else
  puts "We're not even close to sheer time."*

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
*An unless statement is another way to code for a conditional.*
