## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to perform an action and return the result of that action. This action could be as simple as printing a string or as complex as performing a difficult mathematical calculation based on parameters passed to the method by the user.

2. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```Ruby
def hello()
  p "Sam I am"
end
```

3. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```Ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```

4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`hello_someone("Michael")`
