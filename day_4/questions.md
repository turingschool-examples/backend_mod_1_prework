# Day 4 Questions

## 1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

Methods allow you to execute the same piece of code many times without having to type it over and over again.

## 2. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```
def hello(phrase)
  p phrase + "."

hello("Sam I am")
