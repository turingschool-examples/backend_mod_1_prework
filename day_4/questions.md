## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

  The purpose of a method is to allow you to create your own scripts that you can reuse without having to type them out multiple times

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```ruby
def hello()
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

```ruby
hello_someone("Sam")
```

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

   Is it possible to store/save methods so they can be call later, similar to the methods that are "standard"?

   Can you show the code that makes up a method?
