## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
    - A hash is an unordered collection of data that is set to key/value pairs.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

    `pet_store = {puppy: 5, cat: 12, fish: 234}`

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

    `states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?

    `p states.keys`
    `p states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?

    - You might use a hash when wanting to store information about a person like age, weight and height. A hash is better in this case because we do not need the information to be in a particular order, and can access it easier.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

    - N/A
