# Study Drills
# Included only drills that required an answer.
#
# 1. Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what
# the line does.
# See above.
#
# 4. Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate.
# 20.0 is floating point.
# To do this I would follow each number with .0 to make it a float.
