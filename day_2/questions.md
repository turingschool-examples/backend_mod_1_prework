## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.
animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]

1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
animals[2]

1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
animals << "lion"

1. Name and describe two additional array methods:
.include? checks if a string like "Hey how goes it" has "it" and returns 'true' or 'false'. .length will return the length of a string, include spaces and symbols.

1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?
They are values that return back either 'true' or 'false'. An example would be ' p 3 > 5 ' : Ruby would return 'false'. Some other boolean values are || 'or', && 'and', != 'does not equal'.

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
' p 2 == 25 ' and it's false.

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
' p 25 > 2 ' and it's false as well.
