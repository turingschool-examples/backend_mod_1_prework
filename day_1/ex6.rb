#Study_Drills
# [X] 1. Wrote comments above each line explaining what the code
        #was doing in laymans terms.

# [X] 2. Places where a string is put inside a string:
        #two times in line 12, once in 20, & once in 22.
        #One could also consider line 17 as it prints line
        #12

# [X] 3. Boolean values, integer values, and float values
        #do not count as strings within strings. they would be
        #boolean within string, etc.

# [X] 4. Line 38, here, prints this calculation: var_x + var_y
        #So ruby says print w value add e value. Thus the two
        #strings are combined together. Written different ways this
        #may not happen the same.

# [X] 5. In ruby, strings can be either single or double quote.
        #It's proper syntax though to be consistent in your code.
        #so choose one or the other and stick with it.
        #See:
puts '-'*15
K = 'Hello'
A = ' Katherine'

puts K + A
puts '-'*15

T = "Hello"
H = " Lenora"

puts T + H

#Student_Questions
#   [X] 1. Yes, boolean values can be manipulated. That's the whole point of
          #input and code.
