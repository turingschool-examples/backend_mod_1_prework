`.sort` - the sort method can take the elements within an array and sort them alphabetically or numerically in either ascending or descending order

`.join` - this takes the elements within an array and 'joins' them together into a single string, separators can also be used to define what goes in between each element in the newly formed string

`.each` - specifies actions to make upon each item in an array

`.include?` - method that checks for specified elements within an array, depending presence will return a boolean value of true or false

`.collect` - this 'collects' specified elements within an array and stores them as a new array
