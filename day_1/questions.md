1. Name and describe two common string methods:

  `.split()` and `.length()` can both be used on strings.

  *#Split* divides a string into pieces and returns them as an array. #Split can take an argument for the delimiter. A delimeter tells the method where to divide the string. If a delimeter is not defined, the default is first each character of the string, and if there are any whitespaces, the default will instead be whitespace.
  ```ruby
  "Hello World".split()
  # => ["Hello", "World"]

  "Hello".split()
  # => ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o"]

  "Hello, people of earth".split(',')
  # => ["Hello", " people of earth"]

  "Hello".split("e")
  # => ["H", "llo"]
  ```

  *#length* counts the total number of characters (including whitespace) in a given string and returns it as an integer.
  ```ruby
  "Hello".length
  # => 5
  ```
