# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result. You should be able to run this
# file from your terminal with the command `ruby day_1/exercises/variables.rb`

# example: Write code below to save your name to a variable and
# print that variable to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"

print "What's your name? "
name = gets.chomp
p "Hello #{name}..."

# Write code below to save the string 'Dobby' to a variable and

# Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'

students = 22
# YOUR CODE HERE
original_students = 20
newbies = 2
students = original_students + newbies
p "students = #{students}"

# Write the code below to subract 2 students from the `students` variable and
# print the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
