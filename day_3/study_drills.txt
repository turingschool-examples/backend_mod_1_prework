Study Drills

What If?

1. What do you think the if does to the code under it

   if evaluates whether or not the code next to it, which is called an expression
   is true or false and will only print the code below it if true

 2. Why does the code under the if need to be indented two spaces?

   I believe the indentation just makes code easier to read by letting others know
   it is part of a block, which is likely important in larger/more complex code.

 3. What happens if it is not indented?

    The output looks the same when I tested it

 4. Can you put other boolean expressions in the if-statement?

    You can!

 5. What happens when you change the initial values for people, cats, and dogs?

    Depending on what you have changed the values to be different lines will be
    printed when you run this in your terminal.


Else and If:

1. Try to guess what elsif and else are doing

    First Ruby will evaluate the condition for if, if it is true then the code
    underneath it will be run. If it is false, Ruby will go to the elsif statement
    and again if true, the code will be run but if false, Ruby will go to the next
    elseif if there is one and repeat the process. If the if statement and all the
    elseif statement(s) return false, then Ruby will run the code under else.

2. Change the numbers of cars, people, and trucks, and then trace through each
  if - statement to see what will be printed.

    I changed cars to 30, people to 30, and trucks to 42. If we ran that, we
    should see:
    "We can't decide."
    "That's too many trucks."
    "Fine, let's just stay home then."

3. Try some more complex boolean expressions
