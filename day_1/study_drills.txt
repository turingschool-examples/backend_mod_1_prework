Study Drills:

Ex4:

1. Explain the NameError in your own words.
  a. The NameError for carpool_capacity means that the variable didn't have anything assigned to it or it was typed in wrong.

2. I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it is just 4?
  a. Changing 4.0 to 4 has no change on the output, it is just 120 instead of 120.0

Ex6:

1. "Are you sure there are only four places?"
  a. Yes, the only other strings with another variable in it is joke_evaluation but the variable is a boolean value and not a string

2. Explain why adding two strings w and e with + makes a longer string
  a. Due to string concatenation which means joining two or more strings together to create a new string.

3. What happens when you change the strings to use '' instead of ""? Do they still work?
  a. They do not work, you receive an error because of the way do_not = don't is set up. The apostrophe in "don't" acts as the closing single quote instead of an apostrophe so the "t'" causes an error
  b. From what I've read "" is used when there is string interpolation, sequences and contractions. the "" tells Ruby to replace variables with #{} and the '' in Ruby to leave the string as is and ignore variable inside it
