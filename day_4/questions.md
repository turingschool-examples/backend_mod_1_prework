## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

the purpose of a method is to bundle up a bunch of code into something we can reference in a short amount of space, so that we can run that same set of code more easily in different contexts.


1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```
def hello()
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`hello_someone(Sam)`

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

none right now, but i am looking forward to playing around with lamdas and proc's when i have a chance.
