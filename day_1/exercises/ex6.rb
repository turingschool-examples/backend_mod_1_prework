Study Drills:
1) See above
2) Two in line 10, one in line 16 and 18
3) There are other places with an integer or boolean inserted into a string, but no other strings inside of strings
4) It takes the second string and places it on the end of the first string to make one long combined string
5) No, because you use both types of quotes in your code.  You have to keep it consistant or one quote will negate another.
