# Iteration and Each

### 1. If you had an array of numbers, e.g. [1,2,3,4], how do you print out the doubles of each number? Triples?


  ```* Ex:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |ages|
  2.times {print ages }
end


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |ages|
  3.times {print ages }
end```


### 2. If you had the same array, how would you only print out the even numbers? What about the odd numbers?


  ```*numbers = [1,2,3,4]
numbers.each do |ages|
  puts ages if ages.odd?
end


numbers = [1,2,3,4]
numbers.each do |ages|
  puts ages if ages.even?
end```


### How could you create a new array which contains each number multipled by 2?


  ```frogs = [5,6,7,8]
  frogs.each do |ribbit|
    toad = Array.new
    toad.push ribbit*2
    puts toad
  end```


### Given an array of first and last names, e.g. [“Alice Smith”, “Bob Evans”, “Roy Rogers”], how would you print out the full names line by line?


  ```friends.each do |family|
  puts family
end```


### 4a. How would you print out only the first name?


  ```full_names = ["Alice Smith", "Bob Evans", "Roy Rogers"]
full_names.each do |name|
  puts name.split.first
end```

### 4b. How would you print out only the last name?


  ```full_names = ["Alice Smith", "Bob Evans", "Roy Rogers"]
  full_names.each do |name|
    puts name.split.last
  end```


### 4c. How could you print out only the initials?


  ```full_names.each do |name|
  first = name.split.first[0]
  last =  name.split.last[0]
  puts "#{first}.#{last}."
end```


### 4d. How can you print out the last name and how many characters are in it?


  ```full_names.each do |name|
  last_names = name.split.last
  puts "#{last_names}, #{last_names.length}"
end```

### 4e. How can you create an integer which represents the total number of characters in all the names?


  ```# sum_of_names = 0

# full_names.each do |integers|
#   names_split = integers.split
#   names_joined = names_split.join
#   sum_of_names += names_joined.length
# end

# puts sum_of_names```
