## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method helps you consolidate a code that needs to be repeated multiple times in a program. You only need to type the code once within your method, and any time the name of the method is used anywhere else in the program, the code will run.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello(name)

p name

end

hello("Sam I am")

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)

p "#{name} I am."

end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Sam")
