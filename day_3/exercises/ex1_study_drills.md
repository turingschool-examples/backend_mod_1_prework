### What If Study Drills:

1. **What do you think the `if` does to the code under it?**
>"If" executes the code if the condition is true.
1. **Why does the code under the `if` need to be indented two spaces?**
>So that other programmers know that it is a block of code.
1. **What happens if it isn't indented?**
>Ruby won't know where your `if-statement` ends and where others being, so it will throw an error.
1. **Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the `if-statement`?**
>Tested ||, &&, and != in `ex1.rb` file
1. **What happens if you change the initial values for `people`, `cats`, and `dogs`?**
>It will change the outcome of all the conditional code.
