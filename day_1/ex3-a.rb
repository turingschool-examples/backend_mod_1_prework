# This program calculates the Earth's movement
# The Earth has three motions: rotation, revolution, and equinoctial precession

puts "We can't feel it but the Earth moves around."
puts "We can see the sun go up and down."
puts "But actually, that's us rotating around the polar axis, every #{3600 / 3600 * 60 / 60 * 24 / 24} day."
puts "We also revolve along the Sun's orbit every #{3600 / 3600 * 60 / 60 * 24 / 24 * 365 / 365} year."
puts "It takes a long time to notice but the Earth's polar axis actually wobbles around too!"
puts "It takes #{7 / 7 * 52 / 52 * 26000} years for it to wobble all the way around!"
puts "The wobbling of the Earth's axis is called precession."
