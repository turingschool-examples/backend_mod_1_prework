6. Name and describe two common string methods:
 - **.length**
This generates a strings character length, including spaces.

example = "This is how to use the .sub method. This sentence will have the first H that appears capitalized."
p example.sub("h","H") #=> THis is how to use the .sub method. This sentence will have the first H that appears capitalized.

example2 = "This is how to use the .gsub method. This sentence will have all capital H's"
p example.gsub("h","H") #=> THis is How to use tHe .gsub metHod. THis sentence will have all capital H's
```
