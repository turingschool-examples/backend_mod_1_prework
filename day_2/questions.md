## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
```ruby
["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]
```
1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.
```ruby
animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]
```
1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
```ruby
animals[1]
```
1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
```ruby
animals.push("lion")
```
1. Name and describe two additional array methods:
`count`: Returns the count, or number of elements within the array.
`length`: This gives the length of the array returned as an integer.
1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?
Boolean values are logical expressions that determine if a condition is either true or false base on the logic combinations of ==, &&, ||, !=, !, >=, <=, true, false, >, <
1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
```ruby
2 == 25 # this would result in false because 2 does not equal 25
```
1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
```ruby
25 > 2 # this would result in true because 25 is greater than 2.
```
