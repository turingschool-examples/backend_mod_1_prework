## Study Drills ##
# function checklist
#1. Did you start your function definition with def?
#2. Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
#3. Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the function name?
#4. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis ( separated by commas?
#5. Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
#6. Did you put a close parenthesis ) after the arguments?
#7. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function two spaces?

#When you run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:

#1. Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
#2. Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
#3. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
#4. did you en dthe function call with a ) character?
#5. Functions that don't have parameters do not need the () after them, but would it be clearer if you wrote them anyway?

# repeat this outloud whenever you read it
#"To 'run', 'call', or 'use' a function all mean the same thing."
