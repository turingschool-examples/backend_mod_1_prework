#Study drills
#1 add comments to each line of code
#2. find all the places where a string is put inside a string.
#  line3  line 9  line 15  line 16  line 21
#3. I found 5 lines
#4. explain why adding two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.
# becasue it adds the value of variables w and e together
#5. What happens when you change the strings to use '(single-quote) instead of " double quote? do they still work?
# In some cases no becasue for instance in line 7 the single ' is used in the word don't so im assuming it starts using the single quote in that instance.
