## Checker Board:

For the checkerboard, I would use a single nested while loop.  I would start the iterating variables at 0, and as they increased, I would use the modulus operator to determine whether there should be a black or white square there.

(I'm not really sure how much notes you want, I'm gonna make the program anyway)
