## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
  * A hash is an organized collection of keys and values pairs

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
  * pet_store = {dogs: 50, fish: 40, cats: 1, rabbit: 2, turtle: 7}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
  * states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
  * states.keys
  * states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
  * If I had a list of students and their grades, I'd need a hash because I need to know what each student's grade is. 

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
  * Not at this time.
