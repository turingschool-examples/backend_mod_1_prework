## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is a block of code represented by a def/name/definition that can be called upon easily within the rest of your code by simply using the def/name instead of the whole block of code each time it is needed.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello(string= "Sam I am")
  puts "#{string}"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Sam")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
None off the top of my head, but I'll keep thinking about it and replace this with a question when I think of one.
