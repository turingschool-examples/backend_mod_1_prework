## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
`["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`
1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.
`animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`
1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
I would access the array by writing: `animals[1]`
1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
I can use a push method to add 'lion' to my animals array. Like this: `animals.push('lion')`
1. Name and describe two additional array methods:
The `.shift` method, like the `.pop` method, will remove an element from an array. However, unlike `.pop`, `.shift` will remove an element from the **front** of the array.

Speaking of the front of the array, the `.unshift` method will work in a similar method to `.push`, except that the `.unshift` method will add an element from the **front** of the array.
1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?
Boolean values result in either a true or false. I can use many different comparison operators to return a true or false result: `<`, `>`, `==`, `===`, and the list goes on!
1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
`2 == 25`, and the result will be false.
1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
`2 < 25`, and the answer will be true
