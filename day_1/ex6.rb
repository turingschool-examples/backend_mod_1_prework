# SKILL DRILLS
# 1. I placed a comment above every line explaining it
# 2. There are 4 places where a string is placed inside a string
# 3. There are definetly only 4 strings inside a string. Line 10 has two, like 18 and line 20
# 4. When you combine two strings by the + symbol that places them side by side, therefore making it longer
# 5. Some strings work when you use single quotes some do not. Line 6 works for a single quote, but line 8 has to be a double
# That is because we are wanting a string that has a single quote already in it. We have to have the double quotes so the system knows we want to also print that single quote
# Single quotes also do not work on lines 18 and 20. I think this is because there is another string in this string
