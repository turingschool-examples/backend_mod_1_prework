# Declare two variables - hero_name AND special_ability - set to strings
hero_name = "Jen"

# Declare two variables - greeting AND catchphrase
#   greeting should be assigned to a string that uses interpolation to include the hero_name
#   catchphrase should be assigned to a string that uses interpolation to include the special_ability

# Declare two variables - power AND energy - set to integers
power = 9001

# Declare two variables - full_power AND full_energy
#   full_power should multiply your current power by 500
#   full_energy should add 150 to your current energy
full_power = power * 500

# Declare two variables - is_human and identity_concealed - assigned to booleans

# Declare two variables - arch_enemies AND sidekicks
#   arch_enemies should be an array of at least 3 different enemy strings
#   sidekicks should be an array of at least 3 different sidekick strings
arch_enemies = ["Tom", "Jerry", "Paul"]
sidekicks = ["Micha", "Alex", "Sam"]
# Print the first sidekick to your terminal

# Create a function called assess_situation that takes three arguments - danger_level, save_the_day, bad_excuse
#   - danger_level should be an integer
#   - save_the_day should be a string a hero would say once they save the day
#   - bad_excuse should be a string a hero would say if they are too afraid of the danger_level

# Your function should include an if/else statement that meets the following criteria
#   - Danger levels that are above 50 are too scary for your hero. Any danger level that is above 50 should result in printing the bad_excuse to the terminal
#   - Anything danger_level that is between 10 and 50 should result in printing the save_the_day string to the terminal
#   - If the danger_level is below 10, it means it is not worth your time and should result in printing the string "Meh. Hard pass." to the terminal.

#Test Cases
announcement = 'Never fear, the Jen is here!'
excuse = 'I just remembered I left my stove on.'
assess_situation(99, announcement, excuse) #> Should print - 'I think I forgot to lock up my 1992 Toyota Coralla. Be right back.'
assess_situation(21, announcement, excuse) #> should print - 'Never fear, the Courageous Curly Bracket is here!'
assess_situation(3, announcement, excuse) #> should print - "Meh. Hard pass."

# Reflection
# What parts were most difficult about this exerise?

#Specifically figuring out what was meant with the static and dynamic values what the most difficult for me.

# What parts felt most comfortable to you?

#Everything but creating classes felt the most comfortable to me.

# What skills do you need to continue to practice before starting Mod 1?

#I just need a little more practice when it comes to classes. I also need to better understand when to use self.variable and when not to.
