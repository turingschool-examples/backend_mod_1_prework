#I did the reverse check and noticed a spelling mistake with pice instead of "piece"
#A huge lesson I learned from mod 0 was to check for spelling. One missed letter can result in an error such as saving the wrong file.
#For practice, I also ran it with puts # and if you use puts before the pound sign, ruby will run and your comment will show up.
