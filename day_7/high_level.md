# Checker Board #

**high level steps**


- build def that would take in dimensions and print out a checker board
  - first would need to figure out how to print out the required [x " "] needed for for the board
  - set a var to "X" and " "
  - figure out how to print something without the quotes so its just X and not "X".
  - have a way to make sure that the checker board prints out correctly. As in no "X" or " " are right next to or right above each other. (Maybe if line % 2 == 0 than print " " first. else print "X" first) 
- in def make sure that if anything other than int was passed in that program would not crash.
  - check if the input is int. If not return a string that states your mistake and lets you try again.
  - if odd number is passed in have the program let you know that you have to enter an even number
