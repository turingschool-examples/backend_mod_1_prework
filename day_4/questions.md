## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

   A method encapsulates a block of code so that it can be referred to by a simple term and called as often as desired. This saves repetition and aids in understanding.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

   `def hello
     p "Sam I am"
    end`

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

   `def hello_someone(name)
      p "#{name} I am."
    end`

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

   `hello_someone(name)`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

   Can methods work with non-encapulated data, and is that something you would ever want to do?
