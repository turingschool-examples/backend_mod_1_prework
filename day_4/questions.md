## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
  - The purpose of a method is to reuse a block of code

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
  ```
  def hello()
    p "Sam I am"
  end
  ```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
  ```
  def hello_someone(name)
    puts "#{name} I am"
  end
  ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
  `hello_someone("Harrison")`

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
  - I'm still a little confused on return statements. They are implicit meaning the return keyword is not needed but sometimes the wrong thing was returned when I was playing with. Not really a question but more of a statement.
