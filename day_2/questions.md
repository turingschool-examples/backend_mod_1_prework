## Day 2 Questions

#### 1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.

```
["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]
```

#### 2. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

```
animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]
```

#### 3. using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

I would write out:
```
p animals.at(1)
```

#### 4. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

I would write out:
```
p animals.push "lion", "animals"
```

#### 5. Name and describe two additional array methods.

"+" gives a new array by linking together two arrays to produce a third one.
".empty" returns "true" or "false" depending on whether the array contains no elements.

#### 6. What are the boolean values in Ruby?

Boolean values are "true" and "false".

#### 7. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?

```
p 2 == 25
```
The result is "false".

#### 8. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?

```
p 25 > 2
```
The result is "true".
