## Common Array methods

`.each`: This method runs the code indicated for each element in the array.

`.collect`: This method is similar to .each but executes the given code on the array and returns a new array based on that code.

`.first`: This method returns the first element of an array. .first(n) can be used to get the first few elements of an array depending on the value specified.

`.last`: This method is just like `.first` except returns elements starting from the end of the array.

`.shuffle`: This element returns a new array with the elements randomly shuffle.
