# Study Drills

# 1) Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).
#
# I was right! The # makes ruby ignore everything after it on that line.
#
# 2) Take your ex2.rb file and review each line going backward. Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.
# 3) Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
#
# I didn't find more mistskes.
#
# 4) Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
#
# I didn't find more mistakes.
