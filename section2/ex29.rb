#Study Drill
# 1. The "if" code takes the variables and their value and prints out the statement if it applies if the statment is true

# 2. I'm guessing that the code under "if" is indented two spaces
# because its an option only if above code can be applied.

# 3.Nothing happens. Maybe it is to organize the code for easier reading?

# 5. It will print different statments depending on if they are true or not for the if statments.
