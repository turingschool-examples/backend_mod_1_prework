# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:

def print_name
  p "Severus Snape"
end

# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be
# (man, woman) and the end result might output: "When Harry Met Sally".
