## Day 1 Questions

**How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?**

p, puts, or print would all print "Hello World!" to the terminal.

`p "Hello World!"` would produce the result `"Hello World!"`

`puts "Hello World!"` would produce the result `Hello World!` with a non-printed `\n` for a new line.  The hash rocket `=>` will be on a line below the printed text.

`print "Hello World!"` would produce the result `Hello World!` and the hash rocket will be on the same line as the text.

**What is the character you would use to indicate comments in a ruby file?**

Comments are expressed using the hash, pound, or octothorpe character `#`.  Anything after the `#` is not run as code.  This can be used to explain what the code does or to temporarily disable code.

**Explain the difference between an integer and a float?**

Integers are whole numbers, 1, 5000, 245.  Floats use decimals like 1.0, 24.5, or 99.99999.  While playing around I found a useful method to be `.round(<number of places>)`.  I used this for converting from feet to meters in one of the examples.  Here's how it can be used:

```
height = 70
metric_height = height.to_f / 39.37
puts metric_height.round(1)
```

You will produce a result of 1.8 meters instead of 1.77800355671121 meters.

**In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`**

```
animal = "zebra"
```

**How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?**

```
puts animal
```

**What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.**

Interpolation is using variables or calculations within other blocks of code.  In this example it would be inserting a string into another string (although it could be math or a value of an array etc.).

```
puts "Today we went to the zoo and saw a #{animal}!"

Today we went to the zoo and saw a zebra!
=> nil
```

**How do we get input from a user? What is the method that we would use?**

Input from the user is collected using `gets.chomp`. Gets prompts the user for input and the .chomp removes the attached \n carriage return.

**Name and describe two common string methods.**

`.length` returns the length of a string.  One could use this method to make sure a password is long enough.

`.capitalize` capitalizes the first letter of a string.  This could be used to standardize names for email greetings.
