Overall I'm seeing that arrays are ways to store data (in this case, strings) - the brackets designate the data series to be saved, the quotes designate strings, and the commas separate individual data items. Data is stored starting from 0 and going up at each comma (so when I later asked Ruby to show me "meals[2]" it gave me the third item of data).

.sort - returns a sorted version of the data in the array

.each - systematically goes through each item in an array

.join - returns all array data items joined together

.index - no clue

.include? - Checks whether an object is in an array

.collect - I do not understand this one. What is a block?

.first - designates the first data item in the array (probably shows the same as using a zero?)

.last - designates the last data item in the array.

.shuffle - randomly arranges array data items
