To write the CeasarCipher code:

Make a class CaesarCipher with attributes alphabet (a hash with letters for keys and integers 1-26 for values), and shift (an integer)
Within CaesarCipher, make a behavior code(letter, shift) that takes a letter, capitalizes it, and returns a different letter based on the shift attribute.
Make another behavior cipher that splits a String into individual components and passes each one through code, then recombines them into one string.
