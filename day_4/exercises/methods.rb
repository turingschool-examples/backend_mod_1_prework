# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_4/exercises/methods.rb`

# Example: Write a method that when called will print your name:
def print_name
  p "Severus Snape"
end

print_name

# Write a method that takes a name as an argument and prints it:
def print_name(name)
  puts "#{name}"
end

print_name("Albus Dumbledore")

# Write a method that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints
# their sum. Then call your method:
def add(a, b)
  puts "Adding #{a} + #{b} = #{a + b}"
end

add(1, 2)


# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be
# (man, woman) and the end result might output: "When Harry Met Sally".
# Then call your method:
def pizza(top1, top2)
  puts "The best pizza is topped with #{top1} & #{top2}, everyone knows that!"
end

pizza("cheese", "pepperoni")

# or
# top1 = "cheese"
# top2 = "pepperoni"
