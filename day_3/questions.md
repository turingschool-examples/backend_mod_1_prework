## Day 3 Questions

### 1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement is an if-then statement. With code, *if* a statement is true *then* the code will run. A conditional statements can offer various options for outcome depending on variables or input. Some examples are:
  - If I have $8, then I can buy a burrito
  - If it is sunny, then I will go for a walk
  - If don't shower tonight, then I will shower in the morning

### 2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

If-statements can be useful when gathering input from a user. *If* the user enters a specific answer, *then* you might want the computer to complete a specific task.

### 3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

An if statement in Ruby would be as follows:

```ruby
if conditional [then]
  execute code...
end
```

### 4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You can have multiple conditions by using `elsif`

### 5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

```ruby
if conditional [then]
  code...
elsif conditional [then]
  code...
else
  code...
end
```    
### 6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

Another conditional statement that can be used is the `unless` statement. This statement is only executed when the condition is false.
