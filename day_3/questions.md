## Day 3 Questions

#### 1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement is a block of code that talks to the computer where it can evaluate and process information in order to produce an answer.

  Examples:
  ```
     if number = 25
     if number > 25
     if number < 25
  ```
#### 2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

An if-statement is used to evaluate different options so that the computer knows how to respond to the user or to a program.

#### 3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```
if blue = true
  puts "That's my favorite color too!"
end
```

#### 4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You add multiple conditions to an if-statement by adding elsif and else.

#### 5. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

  example:

```
if number >= 25
  puts "That amount is enough"
elsif
  puts "You will need more then that"
else
  puts "please enter a numerical value!"
end
```

#### 6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

We can use conditionals to make comparisons.
  ```
     10 == 10 ==> true
     "blue" == "red" ==> false 
  ```
