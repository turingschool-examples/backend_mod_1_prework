## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?  

  Methods are ways to reuse multiple lines of code without having to rewrite them over and over again. Sometimes I will have a concept that involves multiple items of a same procedure.  

  If that's the case, I can write a method once and reuse that method over and over again instead of having to rewrite the same lines of code over and over again. It's like recycling a water bottle instead of going out to the store to buy a new plastic water bottle every time I want to drink some water.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.  

  ```
  def hello()
    p "Sam I am"
  end
  ```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.  
  ```
  def hello_someone(name)
    p "#{name} I am"
  end
  ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?  

  `hello_someone('Kon')`

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

  The effects of return, p, puts, and print and how they all work in conjunction or in which case I would use over the other.
