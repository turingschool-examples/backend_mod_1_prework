## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
    A Conditional statement depends on words if or elsif. It provides an option based on if conditions are met.
  Example 1: If shoes = pink puts "It's a girl!" elsif  puts "Its a boy!"
  Example 2: If Height = 6.3 puts "They're Tall" elsif puts "They're short!"
  Example 3: If hand = left puts "Wow, you're amazing!" elsif "You're average."

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
 an if statement would be used to make a decision based on other information.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
'''ruby
if #condition
   true  
end
'''  

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
 To add multiple conditions to an if statement you would add elsif statements.

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
'''ruby
if 4 > 2
  puts "Super!"
elsif 4 < 9  
  puts "Great!"
else
  puts "I'm Sad."
end
'''    
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
if we use !, && ||. these symbols can return whether the conditions are t or f.
