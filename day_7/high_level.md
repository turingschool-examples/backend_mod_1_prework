**Ceasar Cipher:**

In order to solve this, I'd start by creating an array that contains the alphabet because I'd need access to the individual letters. Then I'd work on prompting the user for a word or phrase, I'd probably start with a word since that would be easier, then I'd work from there.

After getting the word from the user, I'd need to split the word up into it's individual letters and assign their index values according to the alphabet. After I've done that, I'd add another prompt for the user to input a number to shift the letters. I'd take that number, add it to the assigned index values I gave the letters earlier, return those numbers back to me and find their new value based on the new index number, then print that back out to the console.
