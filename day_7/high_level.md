## Caesar cipher

A Caesar cipher encodes by shifting the alphabet by a specific number. So for example, if you right shifted by 2, A becomes C.

In order to write a program for the Caesar cipher, I first would need a string of text that needs to be encoded and a number that would indicate the shift of letters. With the provided number, I would shift the alphabet order of letters by that number in order to get the cipher.
Next, I would go down the provided string letter by letter and find the corresponding position in the original order. Then, once I got the position number, I could find the corresponding position in the cipher which will give me the changed letter.

Example:
If I right shifted by 2, the following occurs

POSITION = 123456
ORIGINAL = ABCDEF
CIPHER   = CDEFGH

214     214
BAD --> DCF

```
1. Create cipher  
    1.1 Get keys
      1.1.1 Get string
      1.1.2 Get shift position
    1.2 Create a new alphabet based on the shift position 
      1.2.1 Shift each letter by the number given (also based on the direction given)
2. Use cipher to create a new string
   2.1 Output new string
      2.1.1 For each letter in the original string, get the original alphabet position
      2.1.2 Compare original alphabet position to that in the new alphabet
      2.1.3 Print the corresponding position of the new alphabet
```
