## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
 - A method is a feature within programming that allows pieces of code to be run over and over again in a consolidated nature.  It is a part of a class, and it defines behavior of that class instance.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello(you)
  puts you
end

hello("Sam I am")


1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
 - hello_someone("Jordan")


1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
 - Is "def method_name(argument1, argument2, ... argument x)" a good way to summarize the build and nomenclature of the first line?
 - How much more complex and intricate can methods get?
 - How can I apply this to Day 7 of the Capstone?
