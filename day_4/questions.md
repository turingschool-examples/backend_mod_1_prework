## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

In the same way that a variable represents strings and numbers, a method represents a block of code that carries out a certain function.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
  p "Sam I am."
end

hello

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am." 
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Nell")

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

Methods as this lesson goes over are completely different than the class methods we talked about... correct?
