# Study Drills
# 1. Make your script print another line.
# puts "print new line."
# I commented this out since it wasn't part of the actual exercise.
#
# 2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
# To do this I could wither put an octothorpe in front of all but one line OR
# only write `puts` in front of one line.
#
# 3. Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do?
# Try to find out what this character does.
# The octothorpe makes a line into a comment.
