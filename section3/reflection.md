# Section 3 Reflection

1. ### What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* One thing that was new to me was that people can have different growth mindsets for different aspects of their life.  While that is something new to me, it does make sense after thinking about it.  People have different experiences in life that may effect them negatively or positively in certain areas that make up their perspectives in their ability to grow and develop.

* Some things that resonated with me are practicing, taking on challenges, and making mistakes.  I learn from trial and error and just tinkering around with things to see what makes them work, or not work! Mistakes cement important details in my mind the most!  Probably because it can take extra time and brain power to work thought them.  I've always liked exploring.  It can be easier to be just told what to do, and some days I just need the easy way.  However it's' definitely more fun to explore.
I actually love something from an online fitness instructor says which is, "Get excited about failure, it means you have somewhere to go!"  I agree that once things get easy, they can get boring and monotonous.

2. ### In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

*  I demonstrate having a growth mindset by realizing that I have the ability to learn and grow.  I can take on challenges and come about them.  I've always disliked the saying "It is what it is".  Sure there are some things you just need to let be and cannot change, but I think there are many things in life that you can change.  I may put too much energy into changing things that others may see as a waste of time.  However I usually benefit from going above and beyond.  I look back at things in my life and see how far I've come. I didn't get there just by sitting back and not doing.  I got there through learning, determination, practice, and experience.   Mistakes is what experience is made of.

*  The biggest thing I find to be an obstacle for having a growth mindset is that I often compare myself, my life, my accomplishments, my relationship etc to others'.  Sometimes I feel lost or behind when others in class seem to have more experience in coding than I do.  I try to remind myself that many of us are at the very beginner level and that I am gaining experience as I practice more.  Also I try to limit my time spent on social media and remind myself that social media is often just a highlight reel, not reality!


3. ### What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

   A hash is a collection of data stored in key-value pairs while an array is just a collection of values.
   You access values within the array with keys, unlike arrays which have numbered indexes.

4. ### In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

  ``` ruby
  pet_store = {blue_dog_collars: 21, hamsters: 6, canned_cat_food: 75, bird_toys: 12}

  ```


5. ### Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

  ``` ruby
  p states["IA"]

  ```


6. ### With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the    values?

  ```ruby
  #To get all of they keys:
  p states.keys
  #To get all of the values:
  p states.values

  ```

7. ### What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

   Well I had to Google this.  I wanted an example other than a store or an email like in our exercises.  A basic example is for storing passwords.  Such as the key of username and value of the password.  You couldn't do this with an array because it would not have both the username and password stored together; it would just be one or the other.

8. ### What questions do you still have about hashes?

   I don't have any questions at the moment, but as I continue to explore them, I will update with any further questions!
