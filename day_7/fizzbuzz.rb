# Mostly knew how to do this one, but didn't know how to auto fill an array.
# I found the .new example in ruby-doc and after all the work I did on Classes
# was excited to see it in action.  I called a new object called "range" from the class Array
# and gave it an argument of 100 items in the array and a formula that started with n and increased
# by n + 1.  It is exactly the same as all the examples I did before and was excited
# to see my learning in action!
