## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.

    `["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

    `animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`

1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

    `animals[1]`

1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

    `animals<<("lion")`

1. Name and describe two additional array methods:

    1.`.collect` : this method can step through each element of the array and preform an operation on those elements and store it back into a new array.
    1. `.delete()` : this method will delete elements in the array that fit the arguments inside the parenthesizes. This will delete all instances of that element.

1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?

    `&&`: and
    `||`: or
    `!`: not
    `!=`: not equal
    `==`: equal
    `>=`: greater-than-equal
    `<=`: less-than-equal
    `true`: true
    `false`: false

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?

    `2 == 25`
    This would give you `false` as the result of the evaluation

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?

    `25 >= 2`
    This would give you `true` as the result of the evaluation
