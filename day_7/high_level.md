-To solve the checker board problem, I have been having trouble getting ruby to iterate different outputs one after the next.

  -the first solution I tried to navigate was to use a method that would print "X X X" on the even rows, and " X X X" on the odd rows.  
    ~after failing at this multiple times, i began to move on, and back to this

  -the second solution I predicted would work would be to create a method that prints something first and then something after, and then repeats.  
    ~ I was able to get the program to print both of the strings, however, could not get them to do one after another repeating
