## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  - A conditional statement is a statement that requires something to be either true or false depending on how you set it up  before you running a line of code. Ex:
    `num = 0`

    `if num == 0         

      puts "hello"                                    

    end`          

    `if num == 1

      puts "Bye"

    end`

    `if num == 2

      puts "Hungry"
      
    end`

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  - When you want to return something specific but depending on an input you get. Can also be anything else in fact it does not have to be an input.
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  - if (condition)
      code ...
    end
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
  - by adding the syntax (elsif) underneath the original if statement
1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
  - if (condition)
      code ...
    elsif (condition)
      code ...
    else
      code ..
    end
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
  - You can use a while conditional, the way it works by giving it a condition that is true it will continue running until the condition is false or vise - versa.
