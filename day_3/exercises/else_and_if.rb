people = 30
cars = 40
trucks = 15

# A conditional statement asking if there are more cars than people.
if cars > people
# If there are more cars than people, the computer puts this string.
  puts "We should take the cars."
# If the if statement if false, the computer jumps to this statement.
elsif cars < people
# If there are fewer cars than people, the computer puts this string.
  puts "We should not take the cars."
# This is the last option if both if and elsif are false.
else
# If both statements are false, the computer puts this string.
  puts "We can't decide."
# End closes the set of conditional statements.
end

# This follows the same process with the number of trucks.
if trucks > cars
  puts "That's too many trucks."
elsif trucks < cars
  puts "Maybe we should take the trucks."
else
  puts "We still can't decide."
end

# This makes a final decision about the number of people in the people variable
# vs. the numner of trucks in the truck variable.
if people > trucks
  puts "Alright, let's just take the trucks."
else
  puts "Fine, let's stay home then."
end

# 1. Elsif gives the computer a second option if the if statement is false. Else
# gives the computer an option both if and elsif are false.

# 2. Changing the numbers can cause a different outcome. If all variables have
# the same value, we will always land of the else statement.

# 3. Here is some code I tried:

people = 30
cars = 40
trucks = 15

if cars > people || people > cars
  puts "We should take the cars."
elsif cars < people
  puts "We should not take the cars."
else
  puts "We can't decide."
end

if trucks > cars && people > trucks
  puts "That's too many trucks."
elsif trucks < cars
  puts "Maybe we should take the trucks."
else
  puts "We still can't decide."
end

if people == trucks
  puts "Alright, let's just take the trucks."
else
  puts "Fine, let's stay home then."
end

# The first part equated to true, the second to false (so we landed on the elsif
# statement), and the third to false, because people and trucks are not an
# equivalent value.

# 4. See original code.
