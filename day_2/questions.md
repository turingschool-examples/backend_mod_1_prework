## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
    `animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.
    `animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`
1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
    `animals[1]`
1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
    `animals.append("lion")`
1. Name and describe two additional array methods:
    * `.at(n)` - different way to access a particular array element. You can only enter one index at a time inside the parentheses.
    * `.take(n)` - returns the first n elements within an array. If you enter 0, then it will return an empty array. If you enter 1, it will return the first element in the array.
1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
    `2 == 25` => `false`

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
    `25 > 2` => `true`
