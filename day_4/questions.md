## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
  The purpose of a method is to build your own chunks of code that take some input and give you a result you will use again and again throughout a project.

2. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
  def hello
    p "Sam I am"
  end

3. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
  def hello_someone(name)
    p "#{name} I am"
  end

4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
  hello_someone("Tim")

5. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
  Can you put conditional statements and loops inside of methods to have the method perform different tasks or repeatedly perform a task a certain number of times based upon the argument passed to the method?
