A Caesar cipher can be created with a class and attributes, where each attribute can be affected by a certain method to achieve the result. The attributes would be the text/letters, and how much of a shift is desired.

Once the attributes are assigned to text/letters and shift amount, a method would need to be created to actually move the letters by the desired shift amount, so each letter gets passed through the method the same amount of times.

Then you need call the method, which will give you the result.
