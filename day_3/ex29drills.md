#Ex29 Study Drills

##1. What do you think the `if` does to the code under it?

  I think that the `if` executes the code beneath if the conditional assigned in the `if` returns a boolean value of "true".

##2. What does the code under the `if` need to be indented two spaces?

  I don't think that it *needs* to be indented; I tried it without the indent and it seemed to still function properly, so I imagine this is probably for human-readability rather than a technical need.

##3. What happens if it isn't indented?

  As I mentioned, it seems to still work properly even when not indented. (Also, it seems like the following exercise refers back to these questions but contains a different version of this question.)

##4. Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the `if-statement`? Try it.

  Yes, you can! I saved my most-recent version of ex29.rb with the changes I made to try it, along with changes for the next question.

##5. What happens if you change the initial values for `people`, `cats`, and `dogs`?

  Changing these values enough that the boolean values return differently changes the output of the code in accordance with the new results of the conditionals that follow.
