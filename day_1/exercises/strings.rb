# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_1/exercises/strings.rb`

# Example: Write code that prints your name to the terminal:
name = "Leigh Cepriano Pulzone"
puts name

# Write code that prints `Welcome to Turing!` to the terminal:
greeting = "Welcome to Turing!"
puts greeting

# Write code that prints `99 bottles of pop on the wall...` to the terminal:
little_diddy = "99 bottles of pop on the wall..."
puts little_diddy

# I played around with "p", "print" and "puts" here and was very interested in
# what I saw in my terminal!  I will be digging deeper into the difference between
# all of the options to find what different situations will call for them as I'm
# sure there is a reason why all three do the same thing with slight differences.
# At first I had the strings put into sentences that would print out such as
# "My name is #{name}." But I then changed it to print out just my name as the
# directions specified, I will happily go back and change it if need be!
