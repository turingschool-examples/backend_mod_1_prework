# Backend Mod 0 Capstone Repository

This repository will walk you through the Mod 0 Capstone for the Backend program at Turing.

Each day has a folder containing a `README.md` file with instructions for the day, exercises, and questions. You must complete all the exercises and questions.

# Environment

Before starting on Strings, Floats, Arrays, If statements, etc, we need to do a little more setup to prepare a Ruby-specific development environment.

We'll walk through this process now to make sure we have what we need, and finish with getting started on our first day of homework.

These setup instructions assume that you have completed the setup for Module 0, like installing Atom, xcode-select, Homebrew, git, and Chrome. If you haven't done that yet, please see [the mod-0 environment setup instructions](http://mod0.turing.io/setup-instructions).

Here's what we're going to go over:

*   [Installing Rbenv - a Ruby Version Manager](#set-up-ruby-environment-manager-rbenv)
*   [Installing Ruby Versions using Rbenv](#use-rbenv-to-install-a-certain-version-of-ruby)
*   [Forking and Cloning the Prework Repository](#forking-the-module-0-capstone-repository)


Now, lets get a Ruby version management tool on our machines.

## Set up Ruby Environment Manager: [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#homebrew-on-mac-os-x)

As the Ruby language has evolved over the years, new versions have been released containing new features and various upgrades. The first version, released in 1995, was 0.95, and as of this writing we're at 2.6.

To some extent programs written for one version of Ruby will run just fine on another version,
but sometimes you'll encounter incompatibilities, such that a program needs to be run with a specific version of Ruby.

Additionally, there's some very useful "gems" we use while writing code (specifically the `pry` gem) and we cannot install that very useful tool without first installing and configuring `rbenv`.

For this reason, we'd like to be able to install and manage multiple versions of Ruby on our system. This is precisely the job `rbenv` handles.

#### Installation

We've again included a video walk-through of this step (installing rbenv and the following step, installing a version of Ruby). Check it out, it might be helpful!

[![Walkthrough RBENV and Ruby](images/rbenv-ruby-thumbnail.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3DtqMlK8In0 "Video Walkthrough for RBENV and Ruby Installation")

Similar to Homebrew, rbenv provides a script to get everything installed. Open a terminal with Spotlight search (`Command + Space`) and enter these commands:

```
$ brew update
```
Wait a few moments for `brew` to check its current version and make sure it is ready to be used.

```
$ brew install rbenv
```
Wait again, as brew installs rbenv.

```
$ rbenv init
```

The output from your terminal will be something similar to:

```
$ rbenv init
.
.
.
# Load rbenv automatically by appending
# the following to ~/.bash_profile:

eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

This output is telling you that you will need to add the above line (beginning with `eval`) to your "bash profile".

To do this, in your terminal, enter:

```
$ atom ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will open up your `bash_profile` in Atom so you can edit it. Copy the line `eval "$(rbenv init -)"` and paste it at the END of the `bash_profile` file, and save it.

Check if you did this step correctly by switching back to your terminal and typing `cat ~/.bash_profile`. You should see `eval "$(rbenv init -)"` at the bottom of the output.

Close your terminal and reopen it. This is a very important step since the bash profile is loaded each time a new terminal window is opened.

Now check to make sure rbenv was installed properly. In your terminal, type:

```
$ rbenv versions
```

It should give you a version number rather than an error message.

More information about rbenv can be found [here](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#homebrew-on-mac-os-x)

### Use rbenv to install a certain version of Ruby

Now that we have rbenv installed, we're going to use it to install a specific version of Ruby: Ruby 2.5.1. This is the version we will use in the Backend Program.

If you need another version it'll be the same procedure, just replace `2.5.1` in the instructions with whichever version you want.

Install it with:

```
$ rbenv install 2.5.1
```

It will take a while to finish installing, and print a _lot_ of text to your terminal.

When it's all finished, type:

```
$ rbenv versions
```

and you should now see `2.5.1` listed.

Be careful, there are two different rbenv commands, `version` and `versions`. The first shows you _your current ruby version_. The second shows _all installed versions_.

Switch to your newly installed version with

```
$ rbenv local 2.5.1
```

Now enter:

```
$ ruby -v
```

This shows us what version of Ruby we are running. You should see something like:

```
ruby 2.5.1p205 (2017-12-14 revision 61247) [x86_64-darwin17]
```

You can ignore everything after the `p` in `2.5.1p205`. This output shows us we are running Ruby 2.5.1, which is what we want. If you got something different than `2.5.1`, such as `2.5.0`, go back through the Rbenv installation, make sure you have you successfully edited your `bash_profile`, restart your terminal, and try again.

#### Setting the Default Version

You can tell rbenv which Ruby version you want to use by default:

```
$ rbenv global 2.5.1
```

Once you set the global ruby version, make your terminal aware of this update with:

```
$ rbenv rehash
```

## Terminal

We will be referencing many terminal commands throughout the prework. It is recommended that you practice using terminal commands before getting started. See the `terminal.md` lesson located in the day_0 directory.

### Forking the Module 0 Capstone Repository

Next, we are going to *fork this repository that you're reading right now*. Forking is when you copy a Github repository to your Github account to make your own changes. Think of it like a fork in the road -- you're about to make changes that differ from the main path.

In this scenario, the [Turing Github account](https://github.com/turingschool) owns this `backend_module_0_capstone` repository. You do not have permission to change anything in this repository, so you need your own copy to work on. In order to fork the repository, follow these steps:

####  1. Make sure you are logged in to GitHub (if you are not logged in, log in and come back to this page)

####  2. Scroll to the top of [*this* page that you're reading right now](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/backend_module_0_capstone).

####  3. Click on `Fork` in the upper right corner of the screen

####  4. On the new page, confirm that it says it's the "forked" copy of this repository, with mentions of your username in the URL and repository name.

![confirm new repository belongs to _your_ github account](/images/fork_02.jpg)

## Clone down this new repository

Now that you have forked this repository, the next thing to do is *clone your forked repository*.

Cloning is when you copy a remote Github repository to your local computer.

#### 1. In YOUR `backend_module_0_capstone` repository that your just forked, click on `Clone or Download`

![clone down your copy](/images/fork_03.jpg)


#### 2. If you see `Clone with HTTPS` click on `Use SSH`

#### 3. Click on the copy icon to copy the SSH link to your clipboard.

#### 4. Use your terminal to copy down this repository


1. Open your terminal

```
$ cd .
// This is a shortcut for `cd ~`, which is "change into the home directory"
$ mkdir turing
$ cd turing
$ mkdir 0module
$ cd 0module
$ git clone <ctrl-v to paste ssh link here >
Cloning into 'backend_module_0_capstone'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 678, done.
remote: Total 678 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 678
Receiving objects: 100% (678/678), 237.94 KiB | 851.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (332/332), done.

$ cd backend_module_0_capstone
$ git status .
// If everything worked correctly, you should see:
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

From here on out, all the work you do will be in your copy of this repository. Other text you read here might refer to this as the "prework repository" or "backend prework", and they all refer to your forked copy of this `backend_module_0_capstone` repository.

We've got _another_ video walk-through of these steps here:

[![Walkthrough Day 1 and Git stuff](/images/backend-prework-day-one-thumb.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HYAzk6L63ek "Video Walkthrough for Day 1 & Git Stuff")


Each day's `README` will walk you through the steps you need to take to save your work.

To start, in your terminal, `cd` into the `day_0` directory. Follow the instructions contained in the `readme.md` file, and have a great time!

# Extension once finished with all pre-work (optional)

You're done! You've finished your first Mod 0 Capstone assignment!

If you're interested in challenging yourself _even more_ more and getting a step up in your coding abilities before your first day, we recommend working on either:

- [A back-end grad's advice and useful study resources](https://josh.works/turing-backend-prep-01-intro)
- [Credit Check](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/credit_check).

If you do Credit Check, follow the same steps as you did in the 'Forking and Cloning the Prework Repository' section above to get this repo on your local computer.
