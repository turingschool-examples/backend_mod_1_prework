### 7. How do we get input from a user? What is the method that we would use?

To get input from a user you need to use the `gets` command. It will take the user input, change it and print out the changed version in some way. It may print the user input into a string or add something to it.

The command we use for this is `gets.chomp`. The `gets` will put the user input with `\n`, a new line. The `.chomp` will remove the `\n` new line so that the input can be formatted into a string.
