## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
  * A method is a procedure that performs an action on objects in OOP.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
  ```Ruby
  def hello()
     p "Sam I am"
  end
hello()
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```Ruby
def hello_someone(name)
     p "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```Ruby
hello_somone("Zach")
```

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
  * I got a little thrown off by the puzzle given in the Learn Ruby the Hard Way that got into adding equations inside equations, inside equations.  I ended up figuring it out, but is this going to be a somewhat common thing I will have to learn how to do?  Or is this something that was given for the sake of explaining that you can have functions inside other functions?
