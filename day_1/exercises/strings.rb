# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_1/exercises/strings.rb`

# Example: Write code that prints your name to the terminal:
p "Kate Tester"

# Write code that prints `Welcome to Turing!` to the terminal:
p "Welcome to Turing!"

# Write code that prints `99 bottles of pop on the wall...` to the terminal:
puts "99 bottles of pop on the wall..."
p "99 bottles of pop on the wall..."
# Note the p command keeps the quotes around the string, but puts doesn't. They want p apparently, but I learned puts. Waiting to see if they change that.
