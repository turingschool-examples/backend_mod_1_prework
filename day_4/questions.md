## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
>Methods are used in a way to assign a certain action with a word or phrase.  
>This can be very helpful because it prevents you from having to write the same code over and over.  

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
>def hello  
   puts "Sam I am"  
 end  

 >hello()  

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
>def hello_someone(name)  
   puts "#{name} I am"  
 end   

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
>hello_someone("Arika")

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
>I am still not clear about what return does. I understand that everything until the return will print but nothing after it so I'm not sure why you would include anything after it in your method.
