Try to guess what `elsif` and `else` are doing.

`elsif` takes a look at a second set of conditions if the original `if-statement` conditions are not met.  `else` will execute if both `if` and `elsif` conditions are not met.


Change the numbers of `cars`, `people`, and `trucks`, and then trace through each `if-statement` to see what will be printed.

Changes to variables:
```
people = 11
cars = 9
trucks = 15
```
Results:  
```
We should not take the cars.
There are too many trucks.
Fine, let's stay home then.
```
Try some more complex boolean expressions like `cars > people || trucks < cars`.

Here is the revised code:
```
people = 11
cars = 9
trucks = 15

if cars > people || trucks < cars
  puts "We should take the cars."
elsif cars > people && people < trucks
  puts "We should not take the cars."
else
  puts "We can't decide."
end
```
Results:
```
We can't decide
```

Above each line write an English description of what the line does.
