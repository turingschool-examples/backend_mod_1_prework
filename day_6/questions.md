## Day 6 Questions

1. In your own words, what is a Class?
a class is an overarching group of things that all are made up of the same attributes and behaviors, but each of those specific attributes will be different based on the instance of the class. For example, sandwiches are a class, each sandwich has bread, a main ingredient, and toppings and all sandwiches can be made, eaten, and shared.  But the instances are different- a turkey blt is different than a cheesesteak but they're both sandwiches.

1. In relation to a Class, what is an attribute?
An attribute is a characteristic or a defining feature of a class, like the bread and toppings in the sandwich example.

1. In relation to a Class, what is behavior?
A behavior is an action that relates to the class, like in the sandwich example, a sandwich can be made, eaten, and shared.  A behavior could also be add_toppings to add lettuce to the sandwich.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors
class = Dog
  def initialize(name, breed, fur_color)
    @name = name
    @breed = breed
    @fur_color = fur_color
  end
end

1. How do you create an instance of a class?
Barney = Dog.new("Barney", "Chow", "Light Brown")

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?
classes are a lot and i found this to be an information overload.  I do not understand the vocab and it will take me a while to understand this.  could you show more examples?
