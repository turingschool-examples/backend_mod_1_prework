## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

To bundle a series of actions that can then be called upon, without having to type it all out again.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```ruby
def hello()
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```ruby
hello_someone("Sam")
# => Sam I am
```
