# Function Checklist--for reference
# 1) Did you start your function definition with def?
# 2) Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
# 3) Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the function name?
# 4) Did you put your arguemnts after the parenthesis ( seperated by commas?
# 5) Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
# 6) Did you put a close parenthesis ) after the arguments?
# 7) Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function two spaces?
# 8) Did you end your function with end lined up with the def above?

# When you run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:
# 1) Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
# 2) Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
# 3) Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis seperated by commas?
# 4) Did you end the function call with a ) character?
# 5) Functions that don't have parameters do not need the () after them,
#    but would it be clearer if you wrote them anyway? --> YES
