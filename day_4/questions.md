## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
  > A method in Ruby is similar to a verb in english, they do things to objects. Methods are very useful for creating a block of code that will be used repeatedly.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  ```ruby
  def hello
    puts "Sam I am"
  end
  ```
1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

  ```ruby
  def hello_someone(name)
    puts "#{name} I am"
  end
  ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

  ```ruby
  hello_someone("Jordan")
  ```
  or

  ```ruby
  name = "Jordan"
  hello_someone(name)
  ```

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

> I'm working on developing a better understanding of the logic between Method and Class interactions.
