## Checker Board

Create a file called checker_board.rb and within that file, write a program that will print a checkerboard based on the size *indicated by the user*.  On this board, the black spaces will be represented with 'X' and the white spaces will be represented with ' '. An example of the output for a size 6 board would look like this:

```
X X X  
 X X X  
X X X  
 X X X  
X X X  
 X X X
 ```
