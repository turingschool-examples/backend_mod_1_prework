## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
* ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]


1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

* animals[1]


1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
* animals.push("lion")


1. Name and describe two additional array methods:
* The array method 'count' prints the number of elements in the array. ie) p animals.count --> 4
* The array method 'last' prints the last item in the array. ie) p animals.last --> lion

1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
* I would ask the IRB if 2 == 25. The == signs will ask the IRB if a statement is true or false.

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
