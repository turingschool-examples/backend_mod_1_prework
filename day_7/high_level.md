1. First I would have to define my_cipher to my arguements (word, a)
2. Next i would define a variable equal to an empty string so that whenever I call it I can fill in the string.
3. Take word.each and loop through another letter.
4. Create some kind of if statement that says if = this this letter than this letter.
5. Use next to pass my arguements to my specific loop.
6. call my cipher
