## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.
animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]

1. using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
animals[1]

1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
animals << "lion"

1. Name and describe two additional array methods.
I came across one called 'pop' that gets rid of the last element in an array that was useful. Another one I found that I could see being useful is 'delete_at()' that allows you to delete an element of an array selected by the index.

1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?
Boolean values in ruby are about determining whether something is true or false, which can be used to make a decision.

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
In ruby, it would be written as '2 == 25' and the answer would be false.

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
It would be evaluated with a greater-than sign like so '25 > 2'. The result of the evaluation would be true.
