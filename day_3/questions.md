1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

- A conditional statement is a request for ewither a true or false statement.
  1. 2 < 4 => true
  2. "Kentucky" == "Boring" => false
  3. 2 == 4 || 8 == 8 => true

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

```
if
  puts
end
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

```
if
  puts

end
```

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

```
animals = 4

if animals > 9
  puts "It's a zoo in here!"
elsif animals < 2
  puts "Where are the animals?"
else
  puts "Ah yes, animals for me"
end
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
