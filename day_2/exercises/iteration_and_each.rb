# I was not sure this is exercise was asking for the total number of characters
# for the entire array or for each string inside the array.

# Overall this exercise taught me that I have a lot more digging into arrays
# and methods. After not being able to figure out a few of these methods
# I moved onto the rest of the day_2 exercises; that helped a little
# bit as I brought some of what I learned back to this lesson.
# I have decided to move onto day_3 at this point because I have spent two days
# working on this day now.
# My plan is to push this to GitHub and revisit this at a later time.
# I have put these notes in here in case I'm not able to get back to it.
# I wanted to ensure that the reviewer of this knew that I put a
# considerable amount of effort into understanding the
# concepts and will be revisiting it at a later date.
