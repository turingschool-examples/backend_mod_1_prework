## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?  
A method is used to define a set of code that you can reference later in your script. It helps to keep things streamlined, by removing excess lines of repeated code. It also has the benefit of allowing you to make changes in a single place that will be applied throughout the code.

2. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.  
```ruby
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```

3. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.  
```Ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?  
`hello_someone(Sam)`

5. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?  
At this point I feel that I have a solid understanding of the concept of methods and their application in coding. I am also comfortable with the implementation of simple methods and have an idea on how to construct more complex methods. At this point I just need more practice working through complex methods, and memorizing all of the syntax that goes along with them.
