## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I had never heard about S.M.A.R.T. goals before, however it is definitely something I plan on using in the future. Something that resonated with me was in the video when Carmen Popoviciu said that the growth mindset really comes into play when she is struggling with something or she faces a challenge. This is relatable because I agree that challenges are usually motivating.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

The blog post talks about seeking out challenges and that is something I already do. I am comfortable facing challenges and even often times find enjoyment in it. Something that I do not do, which the article mentioned, is not hesitating to ask for help. I usually spend far too long trying to figure out a solution before I concede and ask for someones help.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash is full of keys and their respective values. An array is just a list of elements.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {
  "dogs" => 32,
  "cats" => 24,
  "fish" => 123,
  "hamsters" => 4
}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

puts states.keys
and
puts states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

Another example where you could use a hash is if you wanted to make a hash of your computer and have all the keys be the type of part and the values the parts you have in your computer

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
How common is the use of hashes compared to the other data types
