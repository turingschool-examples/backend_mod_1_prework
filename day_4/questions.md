## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?\
A method is an action. We can tell our code to do something by using a method. In addition they are useful so we do not have to write the same code over and over again but instead just call the method.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

hello

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

Add hello_someone("Maria")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

I would like more info on how to translate code into layman's terms.
