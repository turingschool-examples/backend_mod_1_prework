## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement makes an evaluation based on a provided value, and gives an output based on that value.  

For example, have the dogs been walked today?  If yes, do nothing, but if no, take the dogs out for a walk.

You can have comparison conditional statements too.  For example, if something costs $20, and I only have $15 in my pocket, I can not buy that thing.

And you can have combined conditionals.  For instance, if it is raining outside, but I don't have my coat, I should stay inside.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
If statements allow your program to be dynamic and give different outputs based on user input or other data.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if logic check
  code to execute if logic check criteria is met
else
  code to execute if logic check is not met
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
You can use the or || operator, or you can use the and && operator

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
if logic check
  code to execute if first logic check criteria is met
elsif logic check
  code to execute if elsif criteria is met
else
  code to execute if neither if or elsif criteria is met
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
For a loop, perhaps?  I know we haven't covered that yet, but something like "For as long as X is true, do Y"
