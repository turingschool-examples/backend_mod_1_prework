## Day 1 Questions

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

  * The simplest way that I would think to do that would be to put:
print "Hello World"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

  * To add a comment I would use the # character.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

  * An integer is a whole number, and a float has a decimal point. My understanding is that this is so that you can work more with the floats beyond basic functions, and integers are more basic but easier to use.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

  * animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

  * print "#{animal}"

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

  * Interpolation is where we stick variables or data inside of strings.
Ex: puts "One of my favorite characters in the movie Madagascar is the #{animal}."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

  * You can use gets.chomp to get input from a saver that you can use in the next line or give that back.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

  * Two common string methods include:
  1. .length - The length method lets you add ".length" to your variable to tell you how long the string is with a character count.
  1. .split - The split method is used to break up your string into smaller strings by typing .split after your variable.
