# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_1/exercises/numbers.rb`

# Example: Write code that prints the result of the sum of 2 and 2:
p 2 + 2

# Write code that prints the result of 7 subtracted from 83:
p 83 - 7

# Write code that prints the result of 6 multiplied by 53:
p 6 * 53

# Write code that prints the result of the modulo of 10 into 54:
# Since I'm not sure if you're asking for 54 mod 10 or 10 mod 54
# I'm going to put both. I thinking you mean the first so I'll
# list that first as my official "answer", ha.


p 54 % 10
p 10 % 54
