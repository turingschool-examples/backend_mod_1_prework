## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
 A method gives code an actionable thing to do and allows a set of code to be reused.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end

hello
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

hello_someone("Pierce")
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```
hello_someone("example name")

```

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

I mostly struggle with abstractions, jargon, when or where an argument is being put or requested. I just need lots and lots more practice.  I'm able to get to a correct answer before I totally understand why some of the time and that's slowly improving.  Undertanding the difference between a method and function as well.
