#Mod 0 Journal Entry

1. When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?

```
When working towards goals, I always write the necessary steps towards reaching my goals in my phone/google calendar. The calendar reminds me of things that I need to achieve and keeps me on schedule in order to get there.

I think this will be very helpful throughout my time at Turing because it will allow me to stay on or ahead of schedule with all projects and assignments. Something I'm always trying to improve on is my organizational skills, so this a great tool to help me succeed.
```

2. As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?

```
My biggest strength is that I'm an excellent team player. I love working with others and collaborating to ensure that the end product is as strong as can be. In my previous career as a high school math teacher, I always enjoyed working with colleagues and making the curriculum as engaging, rigorous, and fun as possible. I think being a team player will help me a lot at Turing based on what I've seen so far. I can tell that the school puts a lot of pride into their collaborative outlook.
```

3. Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.)

```
I typically work best with a small group in a quiet area. Although, I'm quite fine working alone as well, but have to put everything away or I get too distracted. No music, no tv, no phone, etc. I am the most motivated when I get to be creative and create something exciting. I always worked the hardest during my teaching career when designing a fun project for my students to do. It pushes me when I know that my hard work will be recognized and enjoyed by others.
```

4. As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?

```
I think my greatest need for improvement is staying on top of my tasks. I have a tendency to procrastinate on getting work done. Although, this has more so been the case recently after deciding to change careers and being stuck inside due to Covid-19. When starting my new journey, though, I will certainly be more motivated and excited to complete tasks and less likely to procrastinate. I have already seen improvements in my work habits during mod 0 because I'm enjoying the work!
```

5. How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?

```
I think knowing your strengths and using them as much as possible is the key to success in any line of work. There are so many different people with so many different talents that you have to be able to use your strengths to stand above the rest. Working collaboratively and being creative are my strengths, which I think are two very important qualities for a software developer. As I continue as a software developer, I will be able to gain a deeper understanding as to how to use my strengths in this field. And, as I develop a deeper understanding of this career, my strengths will only grow.
```

6. Describe the vision you currently have for your career after Turing:

```
I love building new things and being creative. My vision after Turing is to be able to work in an environment where my team is constantly working on new, creative projects for the benefit of our clients/customers. I would love to be able to work at a company that focuses on team work and collaboration, similar to Turing's vision. In addition, I would love to work at a place that has some freedom in working remotely. My wife is a teacher, so being able to travel, while still working, during the summer would be a huge bonus for me and my future family.
