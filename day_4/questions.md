## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to work as a procedure that allows you to extract coding to one place.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello(name)
  " Sam " + "I am"
end
p hello("name")

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name_2)
  puts "name_2: #{name_2} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Alex")

This will print "Alex I am"
