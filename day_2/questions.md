## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.

["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]

1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

Use the variable name with brackets and, inside the brackets, put the index number of the element I want.  animals[1]

1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

I would use the shovel operator.  animals >> "lion"

1. Name and describe two additional array methods:

The index method takes an argument and then searches the array for the data provided in the argument.  If the data does not exist in the array, it will return nil.  If the data does exist in the array, it will tell you the index position of the data.  

The join method will combine all of the elements of an array into a single object if no argument is provided.  If an argument is provided, it will place the data in that argument in between each element of the array.    

1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?

Boolean values are true and false.  

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?

Use the equality operator.  2 == 25  The result is false.

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?

Use the greater than operator.  25 > 2  The result is true.
