# Day 7 - Build a Thing!

«Congrats on making it through the first 6 days of Prework! Today, you will put together everything you have learned to actually build a program! Hopefully, this will show you how much you have already accomplished in your first week as a programmer!
»
When you have completed the activities for day 7, you will follow instructions to submit your work through a GitHub Pull Request.

## Open your local copy of backend_module_0_capstone
Using your terminal, open your local copy of the forked repository you created during setup. Hopefully you are getting the hang of this, but revisit [day_1](../day_1) for more detail if needed.

## Make a Program

1. Using what you have learned in the last week, complete both of the projects below. Put any files related to the projects you choose in a day_7 directory.

    1. [FizzBuzz](./fizzbuzz.md)
    1. [10 Little Monkeys](./10_little_monkeys.md)

1. When you are finished with your projects, you should add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub.

1. Add a `high_level.md` file to your day_7 directory. In that file, write up high level notes about how you would solve one of the following problems. When you're finished writing your detailed notes, you can also choose to code a solution to the problem(s).

    1. [Ceasar Cipher](./ceasar_cipher.md)
    1. [Checker Board](./checker_board.md)

1. When you are finished with your high level explanation, you should add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub.

1. Log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote prework repository and make sure all work from all the days is there!

## Submission

1. ***[Please complete this form to submit your prework.](https://sites.google.com/casimircreative.com/enrollment/mod-0-capstone-fka-pre-work)*** Be sure to include links to your Professional Development pre-work gist, your Gear Up pre-work gist, and your technical pre-work GitHub repository. The link to your technical pre-work GitHub repository will look something like: `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/backend_module_0_capstone`. (using your own GitHub username, of course!)

And with that form submission, ***you're done!!!*** Any feedback after this has been reviewed will be Slacked to you. Can't wait to see you on the first day of class!!

# Extension (optional, after capstone completed)

You've finished your Mod 0 Capstone assignment! So you're done!!!

But there's always more to learn!

If you're interested in challenging yourself _even more_ and getting a step ahead in your coding abilities before your first day, we recommend working on either:

- [A back-end grad's advice and useful study resources](https://josh.works/turing-backend-prep-01-intro)
- [Credit Check](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/credit_check).

If you do Credit Check, follow the same steps as you did with your capstone to fork and clone the repo on to your local computer.
