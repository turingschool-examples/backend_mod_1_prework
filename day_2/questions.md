## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
```
animals = ["zebra," "giraffe", "elephant"]
```

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.
```
animals = ["zebra," "giraffe", "elephant"]
```

```
p animals.fetch(1)
```
1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
```
animals.push ("lion")
```
1. Name and describe two additional array methods:
```

```.index
```

1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
```p 2 == 25
```
*The result will output as false.*
