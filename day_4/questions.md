## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method extracts a piece of functionality so that you can use that functionality in abridged form throughout your code; while, only having to write it once


1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello()
p "Sam I am"
end

hello()

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
p "#{name} I am"
end

hello_someone("Eric")

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Eric")
