## Day 4 Questions

### 1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is like a block of code that accomplishes a task. It sort of packages the code into a box and anytime you need to use that code, you can just take the box because all the code is already in there.

### 2. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```ruby
def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

hello
```   

### 3. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

name = "Jack Frost"
```


### 4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

To call or run the method above you would need to use `hello_someone(name)`


### 5. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

In a "real world" setting. When are methods used the most?
