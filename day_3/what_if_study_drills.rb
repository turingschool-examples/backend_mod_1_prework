# What do you think the if does to the code under it?
  # The if makes the code under it conditional or dependent on the if statement.
# Why does the code under the if need to be indented two spaces?
  # The code needs to be indented to show what code is dependent on the if statement. For readability.
# What happens if it isn't indented?
  # Nothing, it's just more difficult for the coder to see what's going on.
# Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the if-statement? Try it.
  # Yes, you can. EX:
  dogs = 30
  if dogs != 30
    puts "Not enough dogs."
  else puts "Good amount of dogs."
  end
# What happens if you change the initial values for people, cats, and dogs?
 # It will change the output depending on if the new if statements return true or false.
