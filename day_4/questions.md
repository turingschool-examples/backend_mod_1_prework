## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method allows you to create and name a piece of code that you might want to quickly call on in other parts of your code. Instead of typing out the entire code you need every time it comes up in other parts of the code, you can use the method name to tell ruby to run the piece of code associated with that name.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("name")

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
None at the moment.
