## What do the following expressions evaluate to?

1. x = 2
  ```
  => 2
  ```

2. puts x = 2
  ```
  2
  => nil
  ```

3. p name = "Joe"
  ```
  "Joe"
  => "Joe"
  ```

4. four = "four"
  ```
  => "four"
  ```

5. print something = "nothing"
  ```
  nothing=> nil
  ```
  i'm not sure why this returns nothing and nil on one line and loses the quotes...
