## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
A method is used to create a function that returns a value.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```Ruby
def hello_someone
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```
1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```Ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
end
hello_someone("Frank")
```  
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
Calling the method with the name I require as the argument
ex: hello_someone("Frank")

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
nothing yet. I have a lot more work to do.
