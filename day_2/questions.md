## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
```ruby
animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]
```

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.
```ruby
# Already did this!
```

1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
```ruby
animals[1]
```

1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
```ruby
animals.insert(3, "lion")
```

1. Name and describe two additional array methods:
```Ruby
# .last can be used to get the last item in the arrays
animals.last
# animals.last accesses "lion"

# .pop an be used to remove the last element in my arrays
animals.pop
# animals.pop removes "lion"
```

1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?
```Ruby
# Boolean values are logic statements (true or false, usually)

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
```ruby
2 == 25
#result would be false
```

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
```Ruby
25 > 2
#result would be true
```
