## Day 4 Questions

**1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?**

The purpose of a method is a way to recall code without having to rewrite the same piece of code over and over.

**2. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.**
```
def hello
  p "Sam I Am"
end
```
***
**3. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.**
```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```

**4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?**

hello_someone("insert_name")

**5. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?**

Currently, I have no questions regarding methods in Ruby. However, I'm sure they will come up once the code starts becoming more complex.
