* First I would create an array of the aplhabet.

* then I would want to find a way to shift the alphabet based on a word and a shift number. then add for a user to imput their own word and shift number.

* Then i'd want to run the process of shifting it and returning it to the user.

* Then i would want to build the board.

* Then i would want to create a alternating pattern using 'X' for the black spaces and '' representing the white spaces
