# Study Drills
# 1) Make your script print another line.
puts "Hello World!"
puts "Hello Again"
puts "I like typing this."
puts "This is fun."
puts "Yay! Printing."
puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'
puts "I'm making my script print another line."

# 2) Make your script print only one of the lines.
#puts "Hello World!"
#puts "Hello Again"
#puts "I like typing this."
#puts "This is fun."
puts "Yay! Printing."
#puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
#puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'
#puts "I'm making my script print another line"

# 3) Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
#    A octothorpe (#) is used to deactivate parts of our program and allows us to add comments.
