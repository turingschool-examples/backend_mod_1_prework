## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

Conditional statements evaluate to true or false. Here are a few examples:

`2 == 2 || 6 < 2`

`7 < 10 && "hello == "hello"`

`money < 2`

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

One might use an if-statement if you want to create a branch in your code to test out different conditional statements.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

`if`

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

One can use `else` or `elsif`

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

```
people = 30

if people < 30
  puts "Not enough people"
elsif people > 30
  puts "You have too many people"
else
  puts "This is just the right amount of people"
end
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

We could use an `unless` statement to check if something is false. Perhaps we could also use an if-statement in our mini-test program to create tests for our code.
