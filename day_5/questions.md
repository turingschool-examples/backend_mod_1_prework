## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

Hashes are like arrays in that they can hold multiple elements.  However each element is divided into `keys` and `values`.  Each key has a corresponding value.

2. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

`pet_store = {"fish food": 4, "dog bones": 55, "cat litter": 300}`

3. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

4. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

p pet_store.keys
p pet_store.values

5. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

Another example might be for assigning a value to an item in the pet store: `pet_store_cost = {"fish food": "$4", "dog bones": "$5", "cat litter": "$11"}``

6. What questions do you still have about hashes?

None at the moment.
