## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?  

  A method allows you to reuse the same lines of code as many times as you want without having to retype the code in every time you want to use it. It also allows you to alter the lines of code and it will effect every instance that the method is called so you don't have to go through your code and change every one.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.  

  ```ruby
  def hello()
    p "Sam I am"
  end
  ```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.  

  ```Ruby
  def hello_someone(name)
    p "#{name} I am"
  end
  ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?  

  ```Ruby
  hello_someone("Jack")

  ```
