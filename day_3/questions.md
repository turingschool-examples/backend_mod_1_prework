## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
*A conditional statement is one in which outputs a boolean value (true/false). Use characters like:*
```
&& (and)
== (equal)
>= (greater than or equal)
```

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
*If statements are really beneficial when the data is dependent on user input.*

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
if array == number
  puts "message"
end
```
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
*by using* ```elsif or else
```

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```
if array == number
  puts "message"
elsif array != number
  puts "different message"
else
  puts "message 3"
end
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
*conditional statements can help us find out if values are true or false, such as if two arrays have the same length, or if one is greater than the other.*
