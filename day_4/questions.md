## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

   A method creates a rule or a function that you can use either by itself or by inputting data through arguments, and then it generates the new content with the new data.

2. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

   ~~~~

   def hello
     puts "Sam I am"
   end

   hello

   ~~~~

3. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

   ~~~~

   def hello_someone(name)
     puts "#{name} I am"
   end

   ~~~~

4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

   You would have to call on the method and input a value for the argument:

   ~~~~

  hello_someone(Josh)

   ~~~~

   

5. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

   I think that I just need to practice more. I seem to be completing the exercises with ease, yet I still do not feel like I fully grasp the idea of methods.
