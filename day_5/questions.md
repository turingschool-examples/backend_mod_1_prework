## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?

An array is a list of data while a Hash could be seen as list of keys with assigned data with key/ value pairs.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  
This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {dogs: 30, cats: 25, fish: 50}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
p states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?

p states.keys
p states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?

To give vague or general keys values that are narrowing down to a specific (or more specific) data.  


1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
Just need more experimenting and practice on iterations with hashes.
