## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is used to execute a piece of code without writing it over and over, and instead having the common pieces repeat for you.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def say(hello)
  puts hello
end

say("Sam I am")

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  puts name + " I am"
end

hello_someone("Sam")

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Sam")

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

I don't have any questions, but I definitely need more practice. I also need to
familiarize myself with the vocabulary.
