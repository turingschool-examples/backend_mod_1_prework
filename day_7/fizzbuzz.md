## FizzBuzz

Create a file named fizzbuzz.rb and within that file, write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 with the following rules:  
* For any number that is a multiple of 3, print 'Fizz'
* For any number that is a multiple of 5, print 'Buzz'
* For any number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'
* For all other numbers, print the number.

The output of you program will look something like this:
```
=> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, ..., 98, Fizz, Buzz
```

### Bonus
Can you write the program so that it will run for any range of numbers?
