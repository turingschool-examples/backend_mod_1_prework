# each animal.
animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"]

animals.each { |animal| print animals _= 5, "  " }
   p animals
end

# Write code below that iterates through a list of animals and prints "The

foods = ["Bread", "Cereals", "Rice", "Vegetables", "Milk", "Yogart", "Fruit"]
foods.each do { |foods| foods + "to shopping list" }

# Create an array of numbers and then iterate over that array to print doubles
numbers = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"]
numbers.repeated_combination(2).to_a
