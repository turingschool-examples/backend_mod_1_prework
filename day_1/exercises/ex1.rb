# Study Drills
# 1) Make your script print another line.
#
#puts "I made my script print another line!"
#
# 2) Make your script print only one of the lines.
#
##puts "Hello World!"
##puts "Hello Again"
##puts "I like typing this."
##puts "This is fun"
#puts "Yay! Printing."
##puts "I'd much rather you 'not'."
##puts 'I "said" do not touch this.'
#
# 3) Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
#
# The octothorpe causes anything appearing after it on a line to not be executed as code.
