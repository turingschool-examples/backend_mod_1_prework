## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
I would say a method is like a mini-program. I think of programs as a collection of code that is designed to do something specific. For example, the program 'Calculator' is a collection of code designed to do A LOT of different things. A method can do things, like calculate certain formulas (like a calculator).

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello(phrase)
  p "#{phrase}"
end

hello("Sam I am")

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
hello_someone("George")

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
I don't think I have any burning questions at the moment, I just need to practice making them a bit more. I've made some before the Turing course and I do find I'm feeling more and more comfortable doing it.
