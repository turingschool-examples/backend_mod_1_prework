## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
It's a statement that's output depends on the input.
For example, here are some conditional statements:

"If I have a job, I'll be able to pay my bills."
"If I have 5 dollars, I can buy a pack of gum."
"If my dog chases cats, I won't get a cat."


1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
You may want to use an if-statement if an output depends on a certain input, or when there are options based off of a certain decision or occurance.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

Normally, there's some variable that has been inputted by the user. The if statement takes that input, and uses it to make decision on outputs.
if
elsif
else
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
by using elsif or else. I also think you can use the || (or) method too.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
There is a certain indentation that occurs.

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
Conditional just means that something is dependent on something else. So we could say something like "if and only if". I'm not really too sure about this question.
