# Study Drills Exercise 5

1. Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one. Make sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.

ORIGINAL CODE
```
my_name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
my_age = 35 # not a lie in 2009
my_height = 74 # inches
my_weight = 180 # lbs
my_eyes = 'Blue'
my_teeth = 'White'
my_hair = 'Brown'
```
MODIFIED CODE
```
my_name = name
my_age = age
my_height = height
my_weight = weight
my_eyes = eyes
my_teeth = teeth
my_hair = hair
```
1. Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Ruby.
```
height = 74
cm_height = heigh * 2.54

weight = 180
kg_weight = weight / 2.205
```
