#####Array Methods

Methods:

**Sort:** This method will arrange each element in the array in alphabetical order by the first letter of each element. If elements are numerical, it will arrange them in ascending chronological order.

**Each:** This method will iterate through all elements (or assigned elements). A block also needs to be created in order for this method to work. The method will run the code multiple times for *each* element in the array.

**Join:** This method will combine the elements in an array into one string.

**Index:** This method will return a number which tells you where the object is located. The first object in an array would be in position '0', the second object would be in position '1', and so on.

**Include?:** This method will tell you if a specific object exists in your array. It will always output *true* or *false*.

**Collect:** This method will allow you to make changes to each object in an array. Similarly to the **each** method, a block is needed in order for the collect method to work.

**First:** This method will output the first object in an array.

**Last:** This method will output the last object in an array.

**Shuffle:** This method will randomize the order of all objects in an array.
