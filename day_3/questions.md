1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

Nothing came to mind immediately, but upon doing some research there are a few situations in which you would use a conditional that do not include an if-statement. You could use a conditional if you simply want a true/false return. Another situation is one in which you would use an unless-statement. This is an exclusionary statement in the format "do something *unless* condition is met". Another option is an if-statement equivalent--a when-statement. Both essentially accomplish similar things.
