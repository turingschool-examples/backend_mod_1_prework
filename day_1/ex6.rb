#2. A string inside of a string is represented on lines: 6, 12, 13, 27?
#3. I found 4 instances of a string within a string.
#4. The command '+' will combine the two variables, in this case a string which will combine what is inbetween the quotes.
#5. Redo the work with single quotes rather than double. I expect it will run the same. I was incorrect, this errored out multiple lines of code.
