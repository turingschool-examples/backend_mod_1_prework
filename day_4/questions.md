## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

> A method is essentially assigning a block of code to a variable that can be called throughout your program. Its like a little island of code.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

>def hello()  
  puts "Sam I am"  
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

> def hello_someone(name)  
    puts "#{name} I am"  
  end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

> To call hello I would only need to use puts hello since no arguments need to be passed in to execute. For hello_someone I would need to call the argument with puts hello_someone and put the argument in the parentheses. The argument can be either a string, integer, float or boolean. However in this case a string would make more sense. puts hello_someone("Cassie")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

> So far I feel like I understand them fairly well but I am sure there will be more questions the further we dive into the concept.
