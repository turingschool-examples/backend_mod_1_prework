Exercise 28 Learn Ruby the Hard Way, Boolean Practice

Study Drills:
1. Try to find as many "equality operators" as you can.
2. Write the names for each of these operators.

== equality, or double equal, will return true if both objects
are equal and false if they are not. Synonymous with eql?
=== case-equality, triple equals, or threequals. Behaves
differently depending on the type of object it is called on.
Returns true if the object on the right "belongs to" the
object on the left. Can be used to test if an object is an
instance of a class.
!= not equal
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
<=> combined comparison operator, or spaceship operator, or three-way comparison.
Useful for implementing custom ways of sorting things.
Can perform greater than, less than, and equal comparisons.
Return values are 0, 1, and -1.
