# Day 6 - Classes

Today, you are going to be learning about Objects and Classes. In ruby, Classes are one of the tools we use to group together specific Methods that are meant to work together, or on the same type of Object. Arriving at Turing with a strong understanding of how to build a class, and how to call Methods on that class will make your first couple of weeks go smoothly!

When you are all done with the lessons, exercises, and questions for today, you will once again use git to save your work locally, and then send your work to Github.

## Open your local copy of backend_mod_1_prework
Using your terminal, open your local copy of the forked repository you created during setup. Hopefully you are getting the hang of this, but revisit [day_1](../day_1) for more detail if needed.

## Class lessons

1. Work through the following lessons. Any files that you create while working can be kept in today's `exercises` directory.

    - [x] [What Are Objects](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/the_object_model#whatareobjects) section from LaunchSchool.

    - [x] [Classes Define Objects](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/the_object_model#classesdefineobjects) section from LaunchSchool.

    - [x] [Classes and Objects Part 1](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/classes_and_objects_part1) from LaunchSchool.

    - [x] [Objects, Attributes and Methods](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#11.-objects,-attributes,-and-methods) from Ruby in 100 Minutes.

1. Work through the files in the day_6/exercises directory.

1. Answer the questions in the questions.md file in the day_6 directory.

## Save your work in Git

When you are finished with all of the day_6 activities, enter the following commands in your terminal in order to save your work to your local git repository:

1. `$ git add day_6/exercises`
1. `$ git add day_6/questions.md`
1. Use `git add day_6/<filename>` to add all additional files that you created today
1. `$ git status` - you should see only green filenames - if you see any that are red, continue to `git add` those files until `git status` shows all green files.
1. `$ git commit -m "Add Day 6 Work"`

## Push to Github

Remember- You've saved your work to git on your **local** machine, but it is not yet accessible through your **remote** Github repository. Push your code up to Github with the following command:

```
git push origin master
```

You should now be able to log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote prework repository and see all the work you did today!
