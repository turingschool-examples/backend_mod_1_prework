## Caesar Cipher Notes
  * Define a function that takes inputs for both the entry and number of spaces moved.
  * Divide the entry string into characters, running each through a code block
      * `.each_char`?
      * `.split`?
      * `.ord` and subtract from the resulting number?
    * The block that each character runs through takes the number of spaces moved input and changes the characters accordingly
  * Rejoin the modified characters into a string
  * Print the new string

  * Call function


## Checkerboard Notes
  * Define function that takes in an integer
  * Have this integer define the number of characters per row && how many rows there are
  * Create code block that has each row alternate between starting with "X" and " " characters
    * End this code block
  * Create code block that has each character in a row alternate between "X" and " " characters
    * End this code block

  * Call function
