## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
```
  a method performs an action on an object. ruby has a ton of existing methods
  already. it also allows a user to create and modify their own custom methods.
```

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```
hello_someone(Pam)
```

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
```
none. i know i have a ton to learn about ruby and methods. i don't even know
how much i don't know. it's difficult to come up with questions when so much
remains unknown.
```
