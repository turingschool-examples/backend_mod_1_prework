## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method? **A method is a set expression, or set of expressions, that returns a value based on parameters set. The purpose/benefit to methods is not having to rewrite code, as the method can be invoked by referring to the method that has already been set/defined.**

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
**def hello**
  **puts "Sam I am."**
**end**

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

**def hello_someone(name)**
  **puts "#{name} I am."**
**end**

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

**puts hello_someone("Jen")**
