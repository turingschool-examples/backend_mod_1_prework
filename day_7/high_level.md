### Ceasar Cipher Notes

To start: I needed to define what a cipher shift was, and to grab the indicated user input for how many shifts were needed. Inside cipher_shift, I knew I would need to specify what I wanted the user to do, by asking "what information needs encrypted?". To ensure my user input was being split properly, I asked for that to be printed before continuing. Then, to complete this project, I had to rotate the information by the user desired number.
