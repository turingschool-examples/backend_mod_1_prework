## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?

arrays have an order and index and have are Manipulated using that index
hashes are more of a library with a key to look up the desired value attached to that key

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store {fish: 300, toys: 500, food: 30}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
states.keys

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
has is better when the order of numbers does not matter. Hashes are also much faster with larger data groups.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
Nested collections is probably the lessons that I am looking forward to again. I had some further questions
as far as Manipulating nested collections.
