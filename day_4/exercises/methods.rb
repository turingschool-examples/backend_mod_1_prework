# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_4/exercises/methods.rb`

def print_name
  p "Severus Snape"
end

# Write a method that takes a name as an argument and prints it:
def print_name(name)
  p name

print_name("Albus Dumbledore")

# Write a method that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints
# their sum. Then call your method:
def sum(num_1, num_2)
  p "the sum of #{num_1} and #{num_2} is: #{num_1 + num_2}"
end

sum(6, 8)

# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be
