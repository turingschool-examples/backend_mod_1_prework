## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is an equation or a series of steps for the computer to work through so that new answers can be found for different problems.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```
def hello(greeting)
  p greeting
end

hello("Sam I am.")

```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

```
hello_someone(Sam)

```

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

I cannot think of any questions at this time!
