## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello
puts "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
puts "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
No specific questions at the moment but would like to review and practice with methods more.
