## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to essentially create a block of code or script that is easily callable so you can run it in other parts of your program instead of having to write out that block over and over again. 

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`

```
def hello(name)
  puts name
end
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`

```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`name("Derek")`
