# The places where a string are put inside of a string are
# puts "I said: #{x}.", puts "I also said: '#{y}'.",
# the variable y accesses two strings. The remainder of the
# strings access an integer and a boolean. So I would stick with The
# 4 strings inside of a string.

# Adding the two strings together makes a longer string because
# the terminal puts the two stings together as if it is an equation.

# Nothing changes when you switch from double quotes to single quotes
# they do the same thing, the important thing is consistancy, if you start
# using your quotes one way, you should stick with it.
