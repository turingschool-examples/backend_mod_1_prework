## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?

  A hash is similar to an array, it can store muliple objects. however it stores
  information as key/value pairs, which only store index of objects.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

  pet_store = {"dog food" => 25, "toys" => 400}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

  puts IA

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?

  puts states.keys

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?

    counting numbers of items in a type. a hash is best because you can store
    types of item in keys and their numeric value in the values
