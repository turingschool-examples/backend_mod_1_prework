## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
A method is a shorthand way to perform a defined series of tasks. Instead of repetitively performing tasks for a standardized process, a method which encapsulates those tasks may be called instead.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello()
  p "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
`hello_someone(<parameter>)`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
I don't have any questions right now.
