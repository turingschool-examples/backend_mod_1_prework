## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.  

> arr = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.  

> animals = arr

1. Using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?  

> p animals[1]

1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

> animals.push("lion")

1. Name and describe two additional array methods:  

> ary + other_ary

*This will join the elements of two arrays into one.*  

> ary & other_ary  

This will create a new array with only the shared elements between the two original arrays.
