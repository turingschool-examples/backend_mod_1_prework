-To solve the CaesarCipher problem I would begin by googling the CaesarCipher Ruby examples available at my fingertips.  This is the best way to figure out how to do something in Ruby

    -I found a few ways to solve this problem
    - the ".rotate command"  rotates strings to different positions in the array.  you can also use .map to map the amount of rotations you want to use in your cipher, thus moving the letters down farther in the alphabet for the encryption.
    -I was not able to get my caesar cipher to work by defining methods, but I believe I came close.
    -I was able to get .rotate to work for encryption of arrays however
