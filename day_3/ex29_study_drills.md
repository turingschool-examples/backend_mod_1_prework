## Example 29 Study Drills

1. The if-statement evaluates a logic expression. If that logic expression comes back true then the if statement will continue to the next line and execute the code under the if statement. If it evaluates false, it skips the indented line.
2. For readability. You don't *have* to have the indent, but it makes it much easier to read and understand the logic.
3. Nothing. The if statement works as intended, it just makes it a headache to read the code.
4. The if statement can take any boolean expression that evaluates to true/false. So yes, you can use any of the other boolean expressions as well.
5. The if statements may return different stuff if you change any of the variable numbers.
