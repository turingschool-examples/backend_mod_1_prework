## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
 - - -
 Methods in ruby are just like functions in other languages. We would use methods to save pieces of code that we use often in our program. This way  we can invoke the method instead of re-typing the same code over and over again.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
- - -
def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
- - -
def hello_someone (name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
- - -
hello_someone("Tylor")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
