# Day 4 - Methods and Return Values

On day 1 of the prework, you learned how to store information in Variables. Today, you will learn about another way to store information; more specifically, how to use Methods to create Return Values.  In programming, we _often_ use methods, so this is an important concept to get familiar with!

When you are all done with the lessons, exercises, and questions for today, you will once again use git to save your work, and then put it in the cloud on Github.

## Open your local copy of backend_module_0_capstone

Using your terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the prework repository. If you are having trouble with this, see the day_1 instructions.

1. Work through the [Methods](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods) lesson from LaunchSchool, up to the `obj.method or method(obj)` header.  Any files that you create while working through this lesson can be kept in the day_4 directory.

1. Work through the following lessons from Learn Ruby the Hard Way. _*Note*: in these lessons, the author refers to methods as functions. We will be using the vocabulary word method at Turing_

    1. [Intro to Methods](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex18.html)
    1. [Methods and Variables](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex19.html)
    1. [Methods and Return Values](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex21.html)

1. Work through the methods.rb file in the day_4/exercises directory.

1. Answer the questions in the questions.md file in the day_4 directory.

## Save your work in Git

When you are finished with all of the day_4 activities, use your terminal to run the following commands in order to save your work to your local git repository.

1. `$ git add day_4/exercises`
1. `$ git add day_4/questions.md`
1. Use `git add day_4/<filename>` to add all additional files that you created today
1. `$ git status` - you should see only green filenames - if you see any that are red, continue to `git add` those files until `git status` shows all green files.
1. `$ git commit -m "Add Day 4 Work"`

## Push to Github

You've save your work to git on your **local** machine, but it is not yet accessible through your **remote** Github repository. Updating our **remote** Github repository with our **local** changes is called **pushing**. Push your code with the following command:

```
git push origin master
```

You should now be able to log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote prework repository and see all the work you did today!
