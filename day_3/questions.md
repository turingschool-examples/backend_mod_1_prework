## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement is a statement that evaluates as ```true``` or ```false```. Conditional statements one or more  conditional operators such as ```==```, ```>=```, and ```<=``` to compare operands

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
You would use an __if-statement__ when you want the output of your program to behave differently in different situations

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
Ruby uses ```if```, ```elsif```, ```else``` and ```end``` in the construction of an ```if statement.``` An if statement starts with ```if``` and states a condition. The line below is indented 2 places and gives a command for when the above condition is true. If there is an ```elsif``` or ```else``` condition (possibility) these conditions follow the same format as the ```if``` condition above. All if statements are closed with ```end```.
```Example:
if (conditional)
  code...
elsif (conditional)
  code...
else
  code...
end
```


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
In an if statement, ```if``` denotes the first condition. When there are only 2 possible conditions, ```else``` is used at the start of the second condition (after _if_). If there are more than 2 possibilities, ```elsif``` is used for the second through penultimate possible conditions. ```else``` is always used for the last possible situation.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
Ruby uses ```if```, ```elsif```, ```else``` and ```end``` in the construction of an ```if statement.``` An if statement starts with ```if``` and states a condition. The line below is indented 2 places and gives a command for when the above condition is true. If there is an ```elsif``` or ```else``` condition (possibility) these conditions follow the same format as the ```if``` condition above. All if statements are closed with ```end```.

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
A lot of automated equipment is controlled by conditional statements. An example would be a hydroponics garden. Water levels, nutrient delivery, humidity and lights are all monitored by sensors that are programmed with conditional statements to turn on or off when those conditions are met.
