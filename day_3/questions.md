## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

   - A conditional statement evaluates *true* or *false*

   - Example - If Ryan is 17, print "he is in high school."  Ryan is 35, so its false.

   - Example - Is the computer made by apple? *True or False*

   - Example - Is 1995 < present year? *true*

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  - Allow an operation to continue to move forward `if` a situation has been met.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

   `if variable x is a string`  `run this code`  `end`  

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

   - Use `elsif`

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

   ```
   num = 3
      if num > 3
        puts "number is greater than 3"
      elsif num < 3
        puts "number is less than 3"
      else
        puts "number must be equal to 3"
      end

    ```      

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

   - We could use conditional statements to determine if two variables match.
