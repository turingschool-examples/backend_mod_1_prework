puts "Why is the solution 97?"

puts "What is 25 * 3? #{25 * 3}"
puts "What is 100 - (25 * 3)? #{100 - (25 * 3)}"

# irb prints the following:
# 100 - 25 * 3 % 4 = 97
# Why is the solution 97?
# What is 25 * 3? 75
# What is 100 - (25 * 3)? 25
# What is (100 - (25 *3)) % 4? 1

# I do not understand and need to move on
# PE(M&D)(A&S) order of operations ...
