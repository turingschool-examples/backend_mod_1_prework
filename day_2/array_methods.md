1 Sort - The sort method will sort the array depending on what is in the array. If it is an array or strings, they will be alphabetical. If it is an array of integers or floats, it will be in numerical order.
2 Each - Each is a method that tells the computer what to do with each element in an array. For example, if you have an array of ["a", "b", "c"] and want to put a dash next to each element in the array, you could use the each method. This will just give you a result, which is different from Collect.
3 Join - The join method will join all elements in an array. If the array is name = ["My", "name", "is", "drew"] then name.join will print Mynameisdrew
4 Index - The index method will tell you where in an array an element is. If we use the same array from above, name.index("drew") will give us "3" because drew is in the position of three (Ruby starts counting at 0)
5 Include? - This method is essentially asking a yes or no question of if an array includes something, which means we will get a boolean answer. name.include?("drew") will give us a true value, name.include("dave") will give us a false value.
6 Collect - This is more or less the same as the Each method, however collect will form a new array in the process.
7 First - Will give you the first item in an array.
8 Last - Will give you the last item in an array.
9 Shuffle - Will shuffle the items in an array.
