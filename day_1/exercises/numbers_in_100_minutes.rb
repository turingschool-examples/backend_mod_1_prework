# Two types of numbers - Integers(whole numbers) and Floats(decimal point)
# +, -, *, /

# Ruby Integers are objects, so they have methods that can be called.
# .times method:
irb(main):028:0> 5.times {puts "Hello, World!"} # .times method called on Integer 5, {block of code which will run 5 times}
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
