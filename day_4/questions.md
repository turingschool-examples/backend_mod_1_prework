## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
> Either the ability to encapsulate code such that you can use it repeatedly, and in different ways, whilst only having to write it once. Or, in my world, they're just functions.
1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```ruby
def hello
    puts "Sam I am"
end
```
1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
    puts "#{name} I am"
end
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```ruby
hello_someone("sam")
```
1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
> I learned all this years ago, sorry.
