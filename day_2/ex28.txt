Drills:
Equality operators
> Greater than
< Less than
!= Not equal
== equal
<= less than or equal
>= greater than or equal
<=> combined comparison operator
=== case equality operator - works as defined by the class of the object
    on the left

.eql?   determines if both have the same type and value (hash equality)
.equal? determines if both have the same object id (identiy comparison)
Identical twins would yield different results, for example
    twin1.eql?(twin2) = true
    twin1.equal?(twin2) = false
