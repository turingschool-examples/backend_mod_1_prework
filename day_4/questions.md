## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is a piece of code that can be run multiple times.  

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Sam")


1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

No at the moment. I'm sure I will have many once I work with them more.
