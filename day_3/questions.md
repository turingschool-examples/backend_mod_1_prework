## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

- A conditional statement evaluates a true or false answer. eg:
 - is 8 >= 5? (true)
 - is "brown" == "browning"? (false)
 - is 11 < 10 && 2 == (4 / 2)? (false)

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

- Use **if** to create logic flow control options. ie: 'if' something satisfies 'this', do 'that'.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```
  if <condition>
    <action>
  end
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

```
  if <condition_1> && <condition_2>
    <action>
  else
    <action>
  end
```

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

```
  if <condition_1>
    <action>
  elsif <condition_2>
    <action>
  else
    <action>
  end
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

- **else** -- basically an 'otherwise' condition. ie: 'if' not this, 'otherise'(else) this.

- **unless** -- 'unless' this condition is met, do that.
