## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
 * A `method` is like a container that takes input and manipulates the input to give output. If it's the same method then it will manipulate the input in the same way.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello
    puts "Sam I am"
end
puts hello
Sam I am
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an  argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
    puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```
hello_someone("Sam")
Sam I am  
```

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
 * I feel like I have a base knowledge of methods in Ruby. I am attending study sessions with my peers in order to grasp the concept better.
