## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  * A conditional statement will only run when an if statement returns true
```
if x > 2
  puts "x is greater than 2"
elsif x < 2
  puts "x is less than 2"
else
  puts "x is equal to 2"
end
```

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  * You might only want a certain piece of code to run based on an if statements value

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
if
  conditional statement
end
```
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

  * use operators like && ||

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```
if x > 2
  puts "x is greater than 2"
elsif x < 2
  puts "x is less than 2"
else
  puts "x is equal to 2"
end
```
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
  * When using a loop you could say while x < 10 do "this"
