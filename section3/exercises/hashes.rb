# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section3/exercises/hashes.rb`

# Example: Write code that prints a hash holding grocery store inventory:
foods = {
  apples: 23,
  grapes: 507,
  eggs: 48,
  milk: 35,
  beans: 63
}
p foods

# Write code that prints a hash holding zoo animal inventory:
zoo = {
  lions: 7,
  giraffes: 6,
  elephants: 8,
  penguins: 15
}
p zoo

# Write code that prints all of the 'keys' of the zoo variable
# you created above:
p zoo.keys

# Write code that prints all of the 'values' of the zoo variable
# you created above:
p zoo.values

# Write code that prints the value of the first animal of the zoo variable
# you created above:
p zoo.values[0]

# Write code that adds an animal to the zoo hash.
# Then, print the updated hash:
zoo['sea_otters'] = 4
p zoo

#-------------------
# Part 2: Email
#-------------------

# Think about all the pieces of information associated with one single email in your inbox.
# It has a sender, a subject, ...

# Declare a variable that stores hash. Each key should be an attribute of an email and each
# value should be some appropriate value for that key. Work to have at least 5 key-value pairs.

# Write code that prints your email hash to the terminal.
email = {sender: 'Redfin',
  subject: 'listings',
  recipient: 'Kerri',
  images: 'homes',
  link: 'unsubscribe'
}

# Write code that prints all of the 'keys' of the email hash
# you created above:
p email.keys

# Write code that prints all of the 'values' of the email hash
# you created above:
p email.values

#-------------------
# Part 3: Many Emails - OPTIONAL EXTENSION
#-------------------

# LONG EXAMPLE:
# Now that we've learned about Objects AND Arrays, we can combine them.

# Check out the following example of an array of Instagram posts:

# posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

# Frankly, that was a very simplified version of the Array the Instagram developers have
# written and work with. Still probably slightly simplified as we don't know what their code
# actually looks like, but it may look more like this:

posts = [
  {
    image_src: "./images/beach.png",
    caption: "At the beach with my besties",
    timestamp: "4:37 PM August 13, 2019",
    number_likes: 0,
    comments: []
  },
  {
    image_src: "./images/holiday-party.png",
    caption: "What a great holiday party omg",
    timestamp: "11:37 PM December 31, 2019",
    number_likes: 13,
    comments: []
  }
]

puts posts
puts posts[0]

# The code snippet above shows an Array with 2 elements. Each element in an
# Object Literal. Each of those Object Literals has 4 key-value pairs. This may LOOK
# a bit daunting - it's OK! You don't need to be 100% comfortable with this, but it's
# good to have some exposure before going into Mod 1.

# YOU DO: Create an array of at least 3 EMAIL Object Literals, using the same
# key-value pairs you used in your email Object above.

# Then, log the email Array to the console.

emails = [
  {
   sender: 'Redfin',
   subject: 'listings',
   recipient: 'Kerri',
   images: 'homes',

   sender: 'Ebay',
   subject: 'auctions',
