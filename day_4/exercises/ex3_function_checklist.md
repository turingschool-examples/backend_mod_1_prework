### Function Checklist:

1. Did you start your function with `def`?
2. Does your function name have only characters and `_` (underscore) characters?
3. Did you put an open paraenthesis `(` right after the function name?
4. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis `(` seperated by commas?
5. Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
6. Did you put a close parenthesis `)` after the arguments?
7. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function two spaces?
8. Did you end your function with `end` lined up with the `def` above?

### Function "Use" or "Call" Checklist:

1. Did you call/use/run this function by typing it's name?
2. Did you put the `(`character after the name to run it?
3. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
4. Did you end the function call with a `)` character?
5. Functions that don't have parameters do not need the `()` after them, but would it be clearer if you wrote them anyway?
