## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

  The Purpose of a method is to save a block of code, to be used as often as needed.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  `def hello()
    puts "Sam I am"
   end`  

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

  `def hello_someone(name)
    puts "#{name} I am"
   end`

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

  for the first: `hello()`
  for the second: `hello(Sam)`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

  Methods can refer or use/contain other methods, right? Is this what was happening in the math puzzle from earlier today?
  How do you limit the types or formats of parameters that a method will accept?
