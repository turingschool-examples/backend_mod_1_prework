1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
the idea behind a method is write a piece of code that is going to be uses several time on you code ones and them just call it with the argument to use it any time you want.
1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
  def hello()
    puts "Sam I am"
  end
1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
  def hello_someone(name)
    puts "#{name} I am"
  end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
  hello_someone(Charles)
1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
my questions is :
when a try to print using 'puts' I have to use quotes ("" or '') but when I use 'p' is I add the quotes, they will appear in  the text?
