## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to manipulate your output by changing your input based on what you want your code to do

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def say  
puts "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(names)
  puts "#{names} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

puts "#{names}"
