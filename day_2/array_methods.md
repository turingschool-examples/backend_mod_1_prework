## Array Markdown
`.sort` method - sorts an array either alphabetically or numerically depending on the array's contents. If the array contains strings, it will sort them alphabetically beginning with A. If the array contains numbers, it will sort them in ascending order.

`.each` method - this will iterate through all of the elements in an array. Can be combined with other actions to do something to each element, like make them uppercased.

`.join` method - combines all elements in the array into a string. You can also specify a separator so you can make the joined string into a sentence. It will turn an array of numbers into a string.

`.index` method - this will return the index position of a specified element in an array.

`.include?` method - returns a boolean value of either true or false based on if the specified element is present in the array.

`.collect` method - takes all elements in one array and returns them in a new array.

`.first` method - returns the first element in an array. Can also return a set of elements like the first two or three elements in an array.

`.last` method - returns the last element in an array. Like `.first` , it can return multiple elements if specified.

`.shuffle` method - this returns a new array with the elements of the original array shuffled.
