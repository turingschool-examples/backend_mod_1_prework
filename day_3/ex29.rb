# Study Drills

# 1. I think the `if-statement` creates a condition that - whether the code
# underneath it is true or false - will give a specific output based on the
# variables.
# 2. We want the code underneath the `if` to be indented so that the human eye
# understands it as part of `if`.
# 3. Nothing happened to the code when it wasn't indented.
# 4. Check
# 5. The `puts` changed and the last `if` statement provided no output.
