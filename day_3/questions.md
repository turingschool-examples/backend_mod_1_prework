## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

...Conditional statements evaluate to `true` or `false`.
...1. `x == y` # expresses whether equality is true
...2. `x >= y` # expresses whether x is greater than or equal to y.
...3. `x < y` # expresses whether x is less than y.
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

...When multiple outcomes are possible, if-statements are helpful to offer instructions at each outcome.
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

`if` test statement
instructions are executed only if the statement is true
`end`
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

...use one or more `elsif` statements or an `else` statement.
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

`if` test statement
  puts output if true
  `elsif` test statement
  puts output if first statement false & second is true
  `else`
  puts output if neither the `if` or one or more `elsif` statements are true
  `end`
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

...If we have variable instructions or inputs from other people which might affect our program, conditional statements could be helpful.  The boolean method also returns conditional answers based on instructions.
