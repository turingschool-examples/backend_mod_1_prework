## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

To create a piece of code you can work with afterwards without having to rewrite it.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello( )
p "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
p "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello( )
hello_someone("Will")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
I don't understand why we need to add "return" if Ruby implicitly does return the value.
