# STUDY DRILLS

# 1. Do this same kind of mapping with cities and states/regions in your
#    country or some other country.

#   - see study_drills39.rb file

# 2. Find the Ruby documentation for hashes and try to do even more things to them.

#   - see study_drills39.rb file

# 3. Find out what you can't do with hashes. A big one is that they do not have
#    order, so try playing with that.
