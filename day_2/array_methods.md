```ruby
common_array_methods = ["sort","each","index","join","include?","collect","first","last","shuffle"]
```
### sort
   rearranges the elements in the array and returns the array in ascending order (0-9 and/or A-Z)

### each
   iterates (performs a action) on each element in the array

### index

### join
   returns all elements in the array as a single string and can also separate the elements if a separator is given

### include?
   checks the array for the given element and returns true if the element is in the array and false if it is not

### collect
   similar to the .each method this iterates over each element in the array, performing the defined action and return an array containing the modified elements

### first
   returns the first element in the array, the element in index 0

### last
