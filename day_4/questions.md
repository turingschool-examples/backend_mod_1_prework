## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
methods help when you need to repeat a piece of code. You can call the method, and it will repeat the code within the defined method. You can tweak certain values in the method when you call it through many different ways.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
puts "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
p "#{name} I am."
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
Just call the actual method and insert what you wish to be inserted in place for "name".
hello_someone(Meghan)

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
I'm sure I'll have a ton later, but I understand what we've done so far!
