# Methods Checklist

1. Did you start your function definiton with `def`?

1. Does your function name have only characters and `_` (underscore) characters?

1. Did you put an open parenthesis `(` right after the function name?

1. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis `(` separated by commas?

1. Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?

1. Did you put a close parenthesis `)` after the arguments?

1. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function two spaces?

1. Did you end your function with `end` lined up with the `def` above?

## When you run ("use" of "call") a function, check these things:

1. Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?

1. Did you put the `(` character after the name to run it?

1. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?

1. Did you end the function call with a `)` character?

1. Functions that don't have parameters do not need the `()` after them, but would it be clearer if you wrote them anyway?

## Mantra

> "To 'run,' 'call,' or 'use' a function all mean the same thing."
