## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional is similar to a fork in the road. Your data approaches a conditional, which tells that data where to go based on some defined parameters.

Example: **if money = 0 -->
puts "I don't have enough money"**

**elsif money = 1 -->
puts "I do have enough money"**

**else -->
puts "I'm either in debt, or I have more than enough money"**

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
An if-statment gives your code some direction. It's a good way to weed data out, or focus in on specific sets of data. A good way to organize as well.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
**if 'condition', followed by
puts "statement"**

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
include && in between the different conditions.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
**if 'condition 1'
puts "statement 1"

elsif 'condition 2'
puts "statement 2"

else
puts "statement 3"
end**


1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement? Yes. I think conditional statements, such as "unless", or "when" could also be useful.
