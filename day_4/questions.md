## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
It allows us to run a piece of code many time without having to write it again and again

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello(a)
  p "#{a}"
end

hello("Sam I am")

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

hello_someone("Sam")

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
I save it in a .rb file in Atom and then run it in the Terminal.

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
My mind is blown. They are still nebulous questions that I think I'll clarify and address with more practice.
