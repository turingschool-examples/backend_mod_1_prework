1 - Go online and find out what Ruby's gets.chomp does.

1A - gets.chomp is a two part process I think. 'gets' takes in user input, in this case the users
age, height and weight. '.chomp' takes off the last character of the users input. in this case the
character "\n" which means 'new line' and is what happens when you hit the Enter key

2 - Can you find other ways to use it? Try some of the samples you find.
