## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to perform an action that either uses the classes attributes or changes the attributes.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

    <code>def hello</code>

    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "Sam I am"</code>

    <code>end</code>

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

    <code>def hello_someone(name)</code>

    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "#{name} I am"</code>

    <code>end</code>

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

<code>hello_someone("Meghan")</code>

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

So far I do not have questions about methods.
