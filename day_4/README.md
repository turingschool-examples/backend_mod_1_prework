# Day 4 - Methods and Return Values

On day 1 of the prework, you learned how to store information in Variables. Today, you will learn about another way to store information; more specifically, how to use Methods to create Return Values.  In programming, we _often_ use methods, so this is an important concept to get familiar with!

When you are all done with the lessons, exercises, and questions for today, you will once again use git to save your work locally, and then send your work to Github.

## Open your local copy of backend_module_0_capstone

Using your terminal, open your local copy of the forked repository you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to enter the directory that holds the repository. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the prework repository. Revisit [day_1](../day_1) for more detail if needed.

## Method Lessons

1. Work through the following lessons. Any files that you create while working can be kept in today's `exercises` directory.

    _*Note*: In some of these lessons, the author refers to methods as functions. They are interchangable here, but at Turing, we will be use the word `method`._

    - [x] [Methods](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/methods) from LaunchSchool. Work up to the `obj.method or method(obj)` header.

    - [x] [Intro to Methods](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex18.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [x] [Methods and Variables](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex19.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [x] [Methods and Return Values](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex21.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

1. Work through the methods.rb file in the day_4/exercises directory.

1. Answer the questions in the questions.md file in the day_4 directory.

## Save your work in Git

When you are finished with all of the day_4 activities, enter the following commands in your terminal in order to save your work to your local git repository:

1. `$ git add day_4/exercises`
1. `$ git add day_4/questions.md`
1. Use `git add day_4/<filename>` to add all additional files that you created today
1. `$ git status` - you should see only green filenames - if you see any that are red, continue to `git add` those files until `git status` shows all green files.
1. `$ git commit -m "Add Day 4 Work"`

## Push to Github

Remember- You've saved your work to git on your **local** machine, but it is not yet accessible through your **remote** Github repository. Push your code up to Github with the following command:

```
git push origin master
```

You should now be able to log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote prework repository and see all the work you did today!
