## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A statement that is written to yield a true or false answer.
*if Georgia goes outside, then she will chase a squirrel.
*if Georgia stays inside, then she will roll on her back and demand belly rubs
*if Georgia does not stay inside or go outside, then she is taking a ride in the car.

Setting up if-statements allows us to determine which direction in the code will go depending on a user's input. It gives the user options and creates branches in the code.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```ruby
if something == a thing
  puts "some string"

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

by adding elsif in the same format as the if statement and an else statement in the same format as the if statement if needed.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

```ruby

If variable == y
  puts "some string"
elsif variable == x
  puts "some other string"
else
  puts "a different string"
end  
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

You can use conditional statements to test your code and see if it is functioning properly.
