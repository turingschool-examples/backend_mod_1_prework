## Day 4 Questions

#### 1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is used to allow you to store a piece of code so that it can be executed on command.

#### 2. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```
def hello(intro)
  p "#{intro}"
end

hello("Sam I am")
```

#### 3. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

hello_someone("Sam")
```

#### 4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

I would write out the code below:
```
hello_someone("Sam")
```

#### 5. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

I have no questions at the moment.
