### Caeser Cipher
* First you would need to use get.chomps to collect user input.
* Then you would need to use ascii to convert the letters to numbers.
* Then you would take the user input in number form now and add or subtract the
* number of shifts that you want.
* Lastly you would convert the numbers back into letters to get your cipher.
