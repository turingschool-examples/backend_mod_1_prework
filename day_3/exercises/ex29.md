## What do you think the `if` does to the code under it?

It creates a conditional response.  If the if statement is true, then it runs the code below it.

## Why does the code under the `if` need to be indented two spaces?

For organization and text formatting that is readable.

## What happens if it isn't indented?

I don't believe anything happens.

## Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the `if-statement`? Try it.
```
if fact == true
  p "The answer is true"
end
```

## What happens if you change the initial values for `people`, `cats`, and `dogs`?

The `if` statements could meet the conditions and the output would differ.
