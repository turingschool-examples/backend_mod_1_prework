## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to change a value or variable or string in some way.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello

  puts "Sam I am"

end  
```
1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)

  puts "#{name} I am"

end   
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```
hello_someone(Zeke)
```
which should return:
```
Zeke I am.
```
1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

I'd say I understand everything that has been taught about methods in Ruby. In addition, the object oriented programming exercises that we did in Mod 0 have a little more context around them and were helpful in understanding methods in Ruby.
