## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
    Methods are useful when you want to perform an action multiple times without having to write the same code over and over.
1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  ```
    def hello
      p 'Sam I am'
    end
  ```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
  ```
    def hello_someone(name)
      return "#{name} I am"
    end
  ```     
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
      `p hello_someone("Matt")`
1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
