1) .sort
This is used to sort an array into alphabetical or ascending numerical order.

2) .each
This is used to take an array and isolate individual strings. Using .each you can isolate every string and apply a method to them individually, or select certain strings based on a defined characteristic.

3) .join
This will take the array and combine it together without spaces. You can however define a variable that you would like to place in between each string.

4) .index
This will show you the position in the array for the string you search.

5) .include?
This can be used to search an array to see if it contains a particular item. It will return "true" if present and "false" if it is not.

6) .collect
This is similar to .each in that it will take each element of the array and apply a selected attribute to it. The difference between .collect and .each is that .collect will then overwrite the original array and save it with the new attributes, .each will not save it as such.

7) .first
Will isolate the first item in the array. You can also select the first + others using .first(n) where n equals the number of additional items to select.

8) .last
Does the opposite as .first, selects the last item in the array. It also has the option to select additional items in descending order.

9) .shuffle
Will randomly shuffle the array into a new order.
