## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

Conditional statements evaluate to either true or false.

100 == 100
100 > 300
200 <= 300

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

So you can customize how you code responds to an input or action. Like if the weather is cold, than you can tell the user to turn up the heat

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if weather == "cold"

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

using elseif or else

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

if weather == "cold"
  puts "Turn up the heat"
elseif weather == "hot"
  puts "Turn on the AC"
else "Don't touch anything!"

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

I did see mention of a loop, however I think that's separate from a conditional statement. I don't fully understand this question, but it looks like you can also use conditions to execute certain additional code if something is true.

I can see something like, if the garage door is open, then start the process of closing the garage door. If the garage is closed, then do nothing

Is that what you're asking?
