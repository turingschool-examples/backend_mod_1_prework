## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples. **Conditional statements return a value of true or false. Examples include: dogs == 10, vacation_days > 7, days_to_christmas >= 22**

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement? **If-statements are helpful in situations an answer can be one of many, and the return is directly dependent on the answer**

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
**if (statement 1)**
**// code block if statement 1 is true**
**elsif (statement 2)**
**// code block if statement 2 is true**
**else (statement 3)**
**// code block if statement 3 is true**
**end**

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
**The && would be used to indicate multiple conditions.** **Example:**
**if cats > 100 && food < cats**
  **puts "You're in some trouble."**
**end**

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
**if chocolate_chips < 25**
  **puts "Need. More. Chips."**
**elsif chocolate_chips == 50**
  **puts "Guess that'll do. Choco Chip Police.**
**else chocolate_chips >= 51**
  **puts "You are a hero. A Choco Chip HERO."**
**end**

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement? **==, >, <, =<, => are all conditional statements.**
