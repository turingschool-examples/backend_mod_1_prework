## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?  

The purpose of a method is to execute a given block of code given certain parameters. Particularly useful for code that will be executed frequently or multiple times.  


1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.  

```
def hello()
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```  

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.  

```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```  


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("William")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?  

Is there method overloading in Ruby like there is in Java? or is it more like Python in that methods can have one and only one signature?
