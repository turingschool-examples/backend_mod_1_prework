# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
puts "My name is #{name}."

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts "I know an elf and his name is #{house_elf}."

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
message = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts "Harry recieved a terrible letter, it said '#{message}'."

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
more_students = students + 2
puts "We started with #{students} students, but now we have #{more_students}!"

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
less_students = students - 2
puts "Maybe next week we will be down to #{less_students} students."
