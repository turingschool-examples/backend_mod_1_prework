## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method allows us to create shortcuts in our code, in a way. we are able to define methods, and then say what we want that methods to do, so in our global script we can call the method by shorthand as opposed to writing desired code repetitively.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```ruby
def name
  p "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```ruby
def hello_someone (name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

p hello_someone

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

I'm understanding the theroy fine enough, and I'm sure everything will make even more sense as we actually start class and proceed through the material. Practice and familiarity are key. I'm not terribly lost or confused with this, at least for now!
