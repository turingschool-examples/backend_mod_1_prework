## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
    Much of the SuperLearner article resonated with me.  I especially can relate to the section about reading a lot and taking care of your brain.  I make a conscious effort to do things that are good for my brain, including eating healthy, exercising, resting, and making mental health care a priority.  In relation to the "adapting a growth mindset" I have always believed that people should strive to expand their knowledge as they get older.  

    One thing that the article should have included was including puzzles and games to improve cognitive function.

    While I know when it is time for me to take a break, I need to make myself take more frequent, shorted breaks before I get mentally fatigued.  In my last career I would sometimes work 8-9 hours with only 0 min to 30 min of breaks.  The job was very mentally demanding. After working a weekend I would often sleep for 10+ hours Sunday night due to mental exhaustion. I now feel conditioned to work that long without a break.  Maybe now I can handle longer times without breaks, but I definitely can tell when I need to take one and will not push the limits in an unhealthy manor.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
    p "Hello World!"

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
    # An octothorpe is used in front of the comment.

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
    An integer is a whole number and a float is a number with a decimal.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
    animal = "zebra"

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
    p "#{animal}"

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
    interpolation is incorporating a variable within a sentence.
    p "The #{animal} is my favorite animal to see at the zoo."

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
   variable = gets.chomp

9. Name and describe two common string methods:
- .upcase method changes all of the letters in a string to upper case.
- .split separates the contents of a string into an array and returns the array.
