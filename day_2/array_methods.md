## Array Methods

1.  Sort  
  *  The sort method allows us to sort our array by a specified parameter, such as alphabetically, or largest to smallest etc.

1.  Each
  *  The each method allows you to iterate through each item in an array. You can input a block of code and each will run that code for each element in an array.

1. Collect
  *  The collect method allows you to return all the elements in a given collection using an array. This collection could be elements multiplied by an integer for example, or the collection could be array elements plus additional text.

1. First
  *  The first method returns the first element in an array, or the first n elements if first(n) is called on the array rather than just first.

1.  Last
  *  Returns the last element, or elements of an array similar to the first method.

1.  Shuffle
  *  The shuffle method returns an array with the elements of the original array shuffled in a random order.
