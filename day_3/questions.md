## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement evaluates to true or false and then, based on the answer, makes a decision.   

''' ruby
if smoke = true
  p "Fire!!"
end

if age = 18
  p "Hey, did you register to vote?"
end

if pencil_tip = broken
  p "Time to sharpen that pencil."
end
'''

2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

To control conditional instructions. You can use conditional statements to tell your computer to make a decision (decide what to do) based on parameters you set in an if/elsif/else structure and the data provided.

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if condition
  something to be done
end

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You can add multiple conditions to an if statement using elsif/else in your if statement.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

if condition
  something to be done
elsif different condition
  something else to be done
else
  another different thing to be done
end

6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

You might use a conditional statement with an unless conditional statement, which acts based on a false result, instead of a true result (if statement).
