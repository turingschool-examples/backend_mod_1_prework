A class is an outline of what attributes and behaviors an object holds.

Attributes define what is in the class.

Behaviors are things the class can do.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors

class Dog

def initialize(breed, age)

@breed = breed

@age = age

def treats

  puts "Who deserves a treat? You do!"

end

def bark

  puts "Arf!"

end

end

1. How do you create an instance of a class?

Using def initialize(x, y) @x = x, @y = y end

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?

I'm still not sure I understand the usage of 'nil' when it's printed in the terminal.
