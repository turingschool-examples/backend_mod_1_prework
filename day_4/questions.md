## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

`A method allows you to repeat the same process on multiple local variables`

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

`def hello()
  puts "Sam I am"
end

hello()`

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

> def hello_someone(name)
>
>    puts "#{name} I am"
>
> end
>
> hello_someone("name")``

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`You will call it using the method name, which in the above example is "hello_someone"`

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

`I wasn't fully grasping the concept of method arguments, until I watched a video that compared the idea of passing arguments to methods to the process of making baseball bats out of raw wood. They used the wood as the method arguments, the machine as the method, where the logic goes to produce a desired behavior, and then the finished bats were the returned values by the methods. After that analogy the overall process made more sense to me.`
