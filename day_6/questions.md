## Day 6 Questions

1. In your own words, what is a Class?

A Class is an overarching descriptor of an object. A class lays the structure of what the object is.

1. What is an attribute of a Class?

An attribute of a Class is a unique characteristic of each individual object within the Class. So for example 'name' is attribute that can be used in multiple objects but will be a unique attribute for each object.

1. What is behavior of a Class?

Behavior of a Class defines what the objects can potentially do. (ie walk, run, speak, play)

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

class Dog

  attr_reader :breed, :class, :name, :herd, :jump, :shake

  axel = Dog.new("German Shepard", "Working", "Axel")

1. How do you create an instance of a class?

You create an instance of a class by adding an object. So something = class.new. So the above example would be axel = Dog.new and Axel is now an instance or object of class Dog.

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?

I am not sure right now. I am absorbing all that I have learned.
