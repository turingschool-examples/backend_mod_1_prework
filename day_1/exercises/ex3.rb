# Study Drills
# 1) Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
# 2) Remember in Exercise 0 when you started irb? Start irb this way again and, using the math operators, use Ruby as a calculator.
# 3) Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.
#
# File name is ex3_study_drill_3.rb
#
# 4) Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.
