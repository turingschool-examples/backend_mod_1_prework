## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
    A conditional statement is a statement that executes a block of code
  on the condition that a specific criteria has been met. Conditional statements
  enable flexibility in programs and allow your programs to make 'choices'.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  An 'if' statement is helpful when you have two or more possible outcomes within a program's
  execution that you would like to achieve depending on different circumstances.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
    if condition_is_met
      execute this
    end
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
   You can use the 'elsif' and 'else' statements.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

  if condition_is_met
    execute this
  elsif this_condition_is_met
    execute this instead
  else
    execute this third option
  end


1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
   'case-when' Statements ( Set case to a variable and then follow with 'when' conditionals associated
   with assigned variable. If none of the 'when' conditionals apply, use an 'else' statement.)
   'unless' Statements ( Unless something is true--Execute this.)
   'while loop' Statements ( While a chosen conditional returns the value of 'true', the block of
      code is executed, once something triggers the return of 'false', the execution ends)
   'until loop' Statements ( Executes a block of code until the conditional returns 'true')
   'for loop' Statements ("for each"- item in a hash or array, the block of code will be executed)
