# In this exercise you will take the logic exercises you memorized and start trying
# them out in Ruby.
# Take each of these logic problems and write what you think the answer will be.
# In each case it will be either true or false. Once you have the answers written down,
# you will start Ruby in your terminal and type each logic problem in to confirm your answers.
