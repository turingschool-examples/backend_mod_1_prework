## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

Conditional statements evaluate to true or false, and they use operators like == or >
```
18 > 3
44 >= 20
1 == 1
```
2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

If statements help with branching decisions. You can check to see if what you're looking for is true, if not move on and run another piece of code.

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
if booleanCondition
  code to execute
else
  code to execute
end
```
4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You include elsif as another condition to check.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
```
if booleanCondition
  code to execute
elsif booleanCondition(2)
  code to execute
else
  code to execute
end
```
6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

Using them for boolean logic statements like using && or ||
