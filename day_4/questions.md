## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
It's a shorter way to write code that a program will use multiple times. It's like a variable for scripts.
1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello()
  p "Sam I am"
end
```
1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
`hello_someone("Sam")`
1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
 I don't have any at this time. I don't know what to ask or how to ask it. I think more doing will clarify the more vague concepts. I would like to know more about chaining methods.
