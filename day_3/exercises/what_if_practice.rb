# Study Drills
# What do you think the if does to the code under it?
    #If will assign a scenario to the action below. Similar to a 'if/then'
    #statement.

# Why does the code under the if need to be indented two spaces?
    #It is part ofa code block, therefore the indentation.

# What happens if it isn't indented?
    #It does not become a part of the code block or 'if statement'.
