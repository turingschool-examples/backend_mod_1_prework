# This error in my own words: The error orginates in line rb:14.
# Because it says 'undefined' I believe the variable was likely spelled wrong.
# When you called the variable in the sentence, ruby didn't find it.

# Study drills...
# 1. 4.0 is not neccessary since we are measuring humans.
#   If we just use 4, the variable output will not have a floating point.
# 2. okay
# 3. check
