# LRTHW Method Checklist"

1. Did you start your function definition with `def`?
2. Does your function name have only characters and underscores?
3. Did you open parenthesis right after the function name?
4. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis separated by commas?
5. Did you make each argument unique? (no duplicated names)
6. Did you close parenthesis after the arguments?
7. Did you indent all lines of code you wan in the function?
8. Did you end your function with `end` lined up with `def` from above?

When you run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:

1. Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
2. Did you put the `(` character after the name to run it?
3. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
4. Did you end the function call with a  `)` character?
5. Functions that don't have parameters do not need `()` after them, but would it be clearer if you wrote them anyway?
