## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.  

Conditionals are statements that evaluate to true or false, usually using a comparators, examples are: `1>2` or `"test" == "testing"` or `!true`  

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?  

You need to run a block of code only when something is true. For example only when a numeric variable is larger than a certain threshold, then you need to divide that number.  

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?  

```
if <conditional>
  <code block>
end
```  


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

Use `&&` for and and `||` for or  

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?  

```  
if <conditional>
  <if code>
elsif <elsif cond-1>
  <elsif code-1>
...
elsif <elsif cond-n>
  <elsif code-n>
else
  <else code>
end
```  


1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?  

Another reason to use conditionals would be to create boolean values
