## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

   Conditional statements are made and then are evaluated to see if they are true or false. For example:

   "Josh" = "Josh" True
   5 >= 2 True
   7 > 11 False

2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

   If you are trying to look at different situations to see if they meet certain criteria, you want to use an if -statement.

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

   First you define your variable and then:
    If variable meets this condition
      puts an affirmative statement
    end

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

   You add elsif

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

   ~~~~

   First you define your variable and then:
    If variable meets this condition
      puts an affirmative statement
    elsif variable meets this condition
      puts an affirmative statement
    else variable meets this condition
      puts an affirmative statement
    end

6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

   We can do something simple like a true or false evaluation, like my example in the answer to question 1.
