## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is a set of key-value pairs. It is different because you look at a value by inputting a key, instead of an index.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

  pet_store = {cats: 5, dogs: 3, cat_food: 9, dog_food: 16}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
  states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
  states.keys
  states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
  We could use a hash for storing people's favorite foods.  You could just input the name of someone you wanted, instead of having to remember what order they are in.
