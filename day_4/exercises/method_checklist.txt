"METHOD CHECKLIST"
FOR THE FUTURE //////////////////

1 // Did you start your METHOD definition with `def`?
2 // Does your METHOD name have only characters and
      underscore_ characters?
3 // Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the
      METHOD name?
4 // Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis (
      separated by commas?
5 // Did you make each argument unique (meaning no
      duplicated names?)
6 // Did you put a close parenthesis ) after the arguments?
7 // Did you indent all lines of code you want in the
      METHOD ... TWO spaces?
8 // Did you end your METHOD with `end` lined up with the
      `def` above?

WHEN YOU 'RUN', 'USE', OR 'CALL' A METHOD, CHECK THESE:
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1 // Did you call-use-run this METHOD by typing its name?
2 // Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
3 // Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis
      separated by the commas?
4 // Did you end the METHOD call with a ) character?
5 // METHODS that don't have parameters do not need the ()
      after them, but would it be clearer if you wrote them
      anyway?

AND REMEMBER ///
TO 'RUN', 'CALL, OR 'USE' A METHOD ALL MEAN THE SAME THING
