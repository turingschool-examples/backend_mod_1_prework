## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
It's when you make a statement built on factors of conditions given. In the case that a specific statement is true, then the condition of that statement affects the outcome. In the condition that the earth is round, then traveling close to the edge of the Earth won't cause you to fall off the Earth. In the condition that the weather is rainy, one should then prepare themselves for the inclement weather if going outside. If the condition of your body shows that you have a broken leg, then the result is that you cannot play sports at 100% capacity.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
You'd probably want to use an if-statement when you're calculating true or false evidences. If you've compiled data and want to be able to tell a story of the results of your findings quickly, this would be a good point of reference.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if (condition)
 then put (result)

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
You first consider the information used to prove the true or false statements. You can relate the other variables to the original if statement on another line below end. Or you can relate the variables on the same line using a boolean method like or (||)

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
if (condition)
   then put (result)
  elsif (different or opposite condition)
   then put (result)
  else (neither previous conditions are met)
   then put (result)

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
To find out if your original information holds validity based off of other findings. If in general, a truth is always true, Then different results could prove that it's finite or not always the case when confronting separate issues.
