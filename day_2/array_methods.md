.sort
This will take the array, and order them alphabetically if they are strings, and numerically if they are integers

.Each
So this one is  a little confusing for me. I know it has to do with object oriented programming, and telling the program to do something over and over again until the result is reached. I would assume this would be something like keep saying "incorrect" until the user enters the correct value, like an answer to a test.

.join
Will add strings together in one strings

.include
returns a boolean response if the string is included in the arrays

 .first
 returns the first X in an array, or just one if it's blank

 .last
 returns the last x in an array, or just one if it's blank

 .shuffle
 will shuffle the array in a random order. i would be curious how this is truely randomized
