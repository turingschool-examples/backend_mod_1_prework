## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array? **A hash is a collection of pairs of keys and values, with no particular order. An array is an indexed collection of objects.**

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
**pet_store = {**
  **"cages" => 5,**
  **"beds" => 7,**
  **"bowls" => 15,**
  **"lamps" => 13**
  **}**

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`? **p states["IA"]**

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
**p states.keys**; **p states.values**

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array? **In attendance, hashes could be used and beneficial if abbreviating first and/or last names.**

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
