## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

Methods help to condense code so that it when it's repeated in a program, it doesn't have to be typed out every time. It makes the code easier to read and navigate.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello(name)

puts name

end

hello("Sam I am")

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello(hello_someone)

puts "#{name} I am"

end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Sam")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

I think my priority is getting used to and remembering the proper syntax.
