## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
- A hash is similar to an array but "values" are stored with associated "keys" instead of with an index.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

`pet_store = {dog_bones: 100, cat_toys: 1000, kibbles: 1245, bits: 23523}`

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

`states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

`states.keys` and `states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

- `book_inventory = {harry_potter: 37, lotr: 43, divergent: 212}`
- Hashes allow you to call exactly what your looking for as opposed to memorizing indexes.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
