2. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

3. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
 * The difference between an integer and a float is that a float has a decimal
point `0.001` is an example of a float. This can also be a float `1.0`. An
integer is a number without a decimal point `23` is an integer, so is `-3`.

6. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
 * Interpolation is putting strings together, I think about it like a collage of strings.
```
example:
animal = "zebra"
p "I want to ride a #{animal} someday."
"I want to ride a zebra someday."
```

8. Name and describe two common string methods:
 * `length` is a method that is used to count the amount of characters in a string
 ```
  Example:
  name = "Leigh"
  p name.length
  5
  ```

 * `times` is a method that is used to repeat the times a string is printed by the amount put in before.

```
 Example:
 3.times do
    p "Hello"
    end
    "Hello"
    "Hello"
    "Hello"
```
