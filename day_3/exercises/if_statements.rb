# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_3/exercises/if_statements.rb`

# Example: Using the weather variable below, write code that decides
# what you should take with you based on the following conditions:
  # if it is sunny, print "sunscreen"
  # if it is rainy, print "umbrella"
  # if it is snowy, print "coat"
  # if it is icy, print "yak traks"

  weather = 'snowy'

  if weather == 'sunny'
    p "sunscreen"
  elsif weather == 'rainy'
    p "umbrella"
  elsif weather == 'snowy'
    p "coat"
  elsif weather == 'icy'
    p "yak traks"
  else
    p "good to go!"
  end

# Experiment with manipulating the value held in variable 'weather'
# to print something other than 'coat'

# conditional statement that prints only one or the other.

# Experiment with manipulating the value held within num_quarters

# If cups_of_flour = 5 and has_sauce = false, print "I cannot make pizza"
# If cups_of_flour = 2 and has_sauce = true, print "I can make pizza"
# If cups_of_flour = 3 and has_sauce = true, print "I can make pizza"

# Experiment with manipulating the value held within both variables
