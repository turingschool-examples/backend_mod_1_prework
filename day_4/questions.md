## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

  - A method's purpose is to recycle code so you don't have to type it and debug it in multiple areas.
  

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  ```
  def hello
    p "Sam I am"
  end
  ```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

  ```
  def hello_someone(name)
    p "#{name} I am"
  end
  ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

  ```
  hello_someone("Sam")
  ```

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

  - Why is `p` sometimes preferred over `puts`?
