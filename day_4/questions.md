## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

  A method allows you to make code snippets that you can call later on in the code. It saves time by allowing code strings to be called several times in a program. Also, it allows you to edit the code in one place and have the changes take effect throughout the program.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  ```
  def hello
    puts "Sam I am"
  end
  ```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

  ```
  def hello_someone(name)
    puts "#{name} I am"
  end
  ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

  `hello_someone(steve)`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

  I am curious what more complex methods would do in an actual program. I also wonder if there is sharing of methods online, because I feel like some complex actions can be built into a method that would be applicable to multiple types of programs. At this point, the methods we've been making are so simple that they seem like too much trouble for what they are worth, but I can see the potential.
