# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result. You should be able to run this
# file from your terminal with the command `ruby day_3/exercises/if_statements.rb`

# example, using the weather variable below, determine what you need to take
# with you to be prepared based on the following conditions:
  # if it is sunny, print "sunscreen"
  # if it is rainy, print "umbrella"
  # if it is snowy, print "coat"
  # if it is icy, print "yak traks"

  weather = 'rainy'

  if weather == 'sunny'
    p "sunscreen"
  elsif weather == 'rainy'
    p "umbrella"
  elsif weather == 'snowy'
    p "coat"
  elsif weather == 'icy'
    p "yak traks"
  else
    p "good to go!"
  end

# Manipulate the variable 'weather' to see if you can print something other
# than 'coat'


##################
# Using the num_quarters variable defined below, determine
# if you have enough money to buy a gumball. A gumball costs
# two quarters. Right now, the program will print
# out both "I have enough money for a gumball" and
# "I don't have enough money for a gumball". Write
# a conditional statement that only prints one or the
# other.

# You should be able to change num_quarters and achieve these outputs:
# When num_quarters = 0, program should print "I don't have enough money for a gumball"
# When num_quarters = 1, program should print "I don't have enough money for a gumball"
# When num_quarters = 2, program should print "I have enough money for a gumball"
# When num_quarters = 3, program should print "I have enough money for a gumball"

  num_quarters = 0

  if num_quarters == 0
    puts "I don't have enough money for a gumball"
  elsif num_quarters == 1
    puts "I don't have enough money for a gumball"
  elsif num_quarters == 2
    puts "I have enough money for a gumball"
  else num_quarters == 3
    puts "I have enough money for a gumball"
  end
