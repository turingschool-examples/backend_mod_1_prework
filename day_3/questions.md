## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
> A set of rules performed if a certain condition(s) is met; If a condition is met, then an action is performed. EX: (1) If a value is less than 10, then display the words "Value is less than 10" on the screen. (2) If the number of dogs equals 30, then display the words "Good number of dogs" on the screen. (3) If the number of dogs does not equal 30, then display the words "Wrong number of dogs" on the screen.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
> To check if a condition is being met. Also, to give different options and outcomes.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
> A when statement. Every condition that CAN be matched = when statement. This is done with a case statement. EX:

variable = 5

`case` (insert variable name here)

`when` (insert range of conditions here, ex: 1..20)

    (insert code block here)

`else`

    (insert code block here)

`end`
