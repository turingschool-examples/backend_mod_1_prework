## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is an efficient way to store a series of actions to be performed repeatedly throughout a script. This way if we want to make a change, instead of making it many many times, we just make it one time in the method and it is implemented everywhere we've called the method.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```ruby
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`hello_someone("Kunga")`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

I guess most of my questions are about practical application and how complex they can become as we begin actually writing code.
