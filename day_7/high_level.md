I found a great ruby guide that allowed me to partially complete this example. I say partially as I was able to set a specific character shift per user-inputed characters, but I wasn't able to give the user the ability to set the shift themselves.

I put all notes on caesar_cipher.rb on my thought process.

I used this resource to help mold my code: https://www.rubyguides.com/2015/03/caesar-cipher-in-ruby/
