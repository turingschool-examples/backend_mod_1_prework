### Writing Methods

1. Did you start your method definition with def?
1. Does your method name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
1. Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the method name?
1. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis ( separated by commas?
1. Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
1. Did you put a close parenthesis ) after the arguments?
1. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the method two spaces?
1. Did you end your method with end lined up with the def above?

### Calling Methods

1. Did you call/use/run this method by typing its name?
1. Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
1. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
1. Did you end the method call with a ) character?
1. Methods that don't have parameters do not need the () after them, but would it be clearer if you wrote them anyway?
