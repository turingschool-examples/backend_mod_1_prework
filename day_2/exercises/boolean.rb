#Boolean Practice
#Study Drills

#There are a lot of operators in Ruby similar to != and ==. Try to find as many "equality operators" as you can. They should be like < or <=.

#Write out the names of each of these equality operators. For example, I call != "not equal."
#Play with Ruby by typing out new Boolean operators, and before you press Enter try to shout out what it is. Do not think about it. Shout the first thing that comes to mind. Write it down, then press Enter, and keep track of how many you get right and wrong.
#Throw away the piece of paper from 3 so you do not accidentally try to use it later.

Exercise 28 Learn Ruby the Hard Way, Boolean Practice

Study Drills:
1. Try to find as many "equality operators" as you can.
2. Write the names for each of these operators.

#This quesion needs to be frased differently.  Maybe Comparison operators.
#based on example I will find all that dont have to be equals

== Equal,
> greater than
< less tha
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
<=> combined comparison operator
=== Test equality
!= not equal to
.eql?
equal?
