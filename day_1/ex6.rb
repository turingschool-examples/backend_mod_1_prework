# Study Guide
# 3. line 10 has two strings inside a string. I think 15 and 17 are the other
# instances of strings inside string. I think the other times, like variable x
# are an example of an interger inside a string.
# 4. They are two like things so ruby can just add them together
# 5. sometimes. If the string has an apostrophe you can't use single quotes
