### Ceasar Cipher

1) Define my condition with two arguments, the message to be encoded and the number of shifts to the alphabet.

2) Create an array of the normal alphabet.

3) Create a hash that combines the normal alphabet array along with a new array that is the normal alphabet, but shifted the number of times requested.  This gives us key-value pairs where the key is the key is the letter given and the value is the encoded letter.

4) Convert the users string into an array.

5) Iterate through the array that you converted from the users string and return the encoded letter for each normal letter.

6) Combine the encoded letters into one string.

7) Print out the encoded message.
