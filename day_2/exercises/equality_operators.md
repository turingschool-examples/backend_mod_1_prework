== | Equal | True if x is exactly equal to y
!= | Not equal | True if x is exactly not equal to y
> | Greater Than | True if x is greater than y
< | Less Than | True if x is less than y
>= | Greater than or equal to | True if x is greater than or equal to y
<= | Less than or equal to | True if x is less than or equal to y
<=> | Combined comparison operator | if x<y then return -1, if x=y then return 0, if x is greater than y then return 1, if x and y are not comparable then return nil
=== | Test equality | (10..20) === 9 returns false
