## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.

```
array = ["Zebra","Giraffe","Elephant"]
```

1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.

```
animals = array
```

1. using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?

```
p animals(2)
```

1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?

```
animals << "Lion"
```

1. Name and describe two additional array methods.
- Slice Method - Slices out a specific index or range of indexes
- Split Method - Splits the string at a common value. Default seperates at spaces. Returns new array.
- Each Method - Will perform a block of code for each instance of the array.
- Collect Method - Runs a block of code over each instance, returning a new array.
- Take Method - Lets you grab a specified # of entries from the beginning of an array.
- Shuffle Method - Randomly shuffles an array, returns the whole array or specific number.
-include? Method - Checks each instance of an array for a specified data, returns true or false.
- Reverse Method - Reverses the order of elements in an array.
- Join Method - Prints out the array as a string, can be used with delimiters(start/end points).

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?

```
p "Is 2 = 25? Answer: #{2 == 25}"

=> "Is 2 = 25? Answer:false"
```

1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?

```
p "Is 25 greater than 2? Answer: #{2 > 25}"

=> "Is 25 greater than 2? Answer: false"
```
