## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
  A method is what is used to affect the attributes of a class or the class itself
  A method is designed to take a class and give it an action or decided if something
  is true or false.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
  hello = p "Sam I am"

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

    def hello_someone(name)
      "#{name} I am"
    end


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

p class_object.hello_someone

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

  When writting methods how is it that the method is actually causing a reaction?
  I think that in order to make something happen you have to define what it is then
  what it will be after the action or method.
