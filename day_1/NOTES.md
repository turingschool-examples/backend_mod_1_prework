# For Instructors Consideration:

I thought it best to include a note file with a couple of observations and possible needed corrections from the lesson.

- In the "An Introduction to Ruby" portion of the README.md file we are instructed to create ex1.rb, ex2.rb, etc, etc files within the `day_1/exercises` directory. When we get to the point that we are going to be adding/commiting to Git, the instructions suggest we add the ex1.rb, ex2.rb, etc, etc files from the day_1 directory when we would need to be in the `day_1/exercises` directory to enter `git add ex1.rb` as instructed. The instructions should probably be modified to have us cd into the `day_1/exercises` directory prior to adding all of the ex1.rb, etc files or to add via `git add exercises/ex1.rb`, or add all of the ex1.rb - ex7.rb exercises via `git add exercises` etc, etc.

- In the "Ruby Basics Lessons" portion of the day_1 README file, in the final sentence of section "i.", we are instructed to "Refer to back to day_0 etc..." - I believe this is a typo and intended to say "Refer back to day_0, etc.."
