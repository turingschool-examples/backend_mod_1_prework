## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
To make coding more efficient. You are able to get so much more done when you can condense your code into a method that can be recalled.
1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

`def hello
  puts "Sam I am."
  end`

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

`def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
  end`

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

type `hello_someone("Sage")`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

How do the methods we create compare the methods we have already been using thus far. Are they pre programmed into ruby?
