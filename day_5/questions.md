## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
Hash allows you to stores values and keys to your variables

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {lizards: 20, birds: 30, hamsters: 60, cats: 10}


1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

states["IA"]


1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
  states.keys
  states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
  items stored in a retail store, would be better because you can store how many of each shirt and size are in stock

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

i'm sure some will come up as i continue working.
