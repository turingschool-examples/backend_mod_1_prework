# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p "'Hello, #{name}. I have been expecting you.'"

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p "'Your house elf, #{house_elf}, notified me of your arrival.'"

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
dobby_script = "'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'"
p "'He has an important message for you.'"
p "#{house_elf} rushes forward and blurts out a concerning message: #{dobby_script}"

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:

p students + 2

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
