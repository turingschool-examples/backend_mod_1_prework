## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

    - The purpose of a method in my eyes is to be able to reuse the same code without having to retype it
    over and over. That is the main functionality of a method to me.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

    - ```ruby
    def hello
        print "Sam I am"
    end 
    ``` 

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
