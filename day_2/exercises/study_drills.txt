Study Drills:

1. Try to find as many "equality operators" as you can
  > greater than
  < less than
  >= greater than or equal to
  <= less than or equal to
  <=> combined comparison operator
    14 <=> 14 #=> 0
    14 <=> 12 #=> 1
    14 <=> 16 #=> -1
  === test equality
  .eql? true if two values are equal and of the same type
  equal? true if two things are the same object

2. Write out the names of each of these equality operators
  *mostly done above but listed additional below*
  && (and)
  || (or)
  ! (not)
  != (not equal)
  == (equal)
