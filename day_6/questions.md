A class can be thought of as a blueprint for a category that helps define attributes and functions for that class.

```
An attribute is a property of an object/instance that is shared among other objects/instances in the same class. Attributes are also known as variables.
```

```
A behavior is an action of an object/instance that is also shared among other objects/instances in the same class. Behaviors in programming are known as functions or methods.

```
class Dog

jump
```

1. How do you create an instance of a class?
