# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby day_1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Leigh Cepriano Pulzone"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
free_house_elf = "Dobby"
p free_house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
chamber_of_secrets = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p chamber_of_secrets

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = 22 + 2
p students


# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22 - 2
p students

# I was unsure if I was being asked to reassign the variable 'students' by typing
# students = 22 + 2 or if I was supposed to create a new variable with the
# variable 'students' in it.
# Also, it was not until I got to the interpolation exercise that I realized the
# first line was just an example which is why you will see all the examples changed.
# What another great lesson learned, read the fine print (maybe a few times...)!
