## Day 3 Questions

### 1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A *conditional statement* is a statement that if proven true, preforms a task or outputs information.

1. *If* I have a job, *then* I get paid.
2. *If* I have 75 cents, *then* I can buy a gum ball.
3. *If* I eat Taco Bell, *then* I explode later.


### 2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

To make use of user input, or to complete a specific task.  


### 3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

An if statement in Ruby would look something like this:

```ruby
if statement = true
  p "Do something"
end
```


### 4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You can add multiple conditions by using the ```elsif``` statement.


### 5. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

```ruby
if statement = true
  p "Do something"
elsif statement = false
  p "Do something else"
else
  p "Nil"
end
```


### 6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

A conditional statement would also be useful if we used it with a loop, so that the program would run until the condition was able to be met.
