1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

```
Class: Dog
Attributes: has_hair(boolean), hair_color(string), number_of_teeth(integer)
Behaviors: run, bark, jump, bite, play
```

1. How do you create an instance of a class?

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?

```
I don't have any questions. I just need to keep practicing so I can feel more confident. I struggled the most in the burrito document when trying to 'remove_topping.' This was difficult for me because one of our parameters/instance variables was an array, and I was struggling to get the array to do what I wanted.
