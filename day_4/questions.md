## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
A method is an action that we define so we can use it later without having to retype it. Like how you can learn the action waltz, and we can call the action on different songs. You will still utilize the new information (tempo), but the motions you take will be the same.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
``` ruby
def hello
  print "Sam I am"
end

hello
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
``` Ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  print "#{name} I am"
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone(Joe)
```

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
None at this time. It is a bit overwhelming, but like the lessons say, most of this will come with time and repetition.
