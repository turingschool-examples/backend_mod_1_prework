1. What do you think the (if) does to the code under it?
> The (if) creates a conditional argument. What I mean by that is it is going through the several options of code until it finds the (true) code block and it will print the given condition.

2. Why does the code under (if) need to be indented two spaces?
> Because if is the statement and the code under it is the code block which is represented by the two indents.

3. What happens if it isn't indented?
> if it isn't indented it gives me an error message.

4. Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the if-then statement?
> Yes you can because the boolean logic symbols determine truth and that is how if then statements work based off of a true or false value.

5. What happens if you change the initial value for people, cats and dogs?
> If you change the initial values it  will make different conditional statements (if then statements) become true or false and result in a different block to be printed. For instance if I make the value of people less than dogs than the block "The world is drooled on would on" would print because that condition is now true.
