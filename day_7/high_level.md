Ceaser Cipher

1 Create hash for Cipher
  1.1 Use the code to determine what letters match what
    1.1.1 Write out the alphabet from A to Z with one letter on each line, wrapped in ""
    1.1.2 After each letter, put a =>
    1.1.3 After each => put the letter from the cipher code that matches the normal alphabet letter
      1.1.3.1 The cipher alphabet starts with X and ends with W, using the same process you did with the normal alphabet, start with X and go down the alphabet and put one letter on each line after the => and wrap the letter in ""
      1.1.3.2 Once you get to "Z", start the alphabet again with "A" and continue going down the list
    1.1.4 After the matching value pair put a ,
  1.2 Create hash
    1.2.1 Put {} around the code breakdown you wrote above
    1.2.2 Create a hash named cipher and set it = to whats in the {}
    1.2.3 Make sure your formatting is correct with => to equate the values and , after each value pair
2 Write code comparing string to Cipher
3 Return string
