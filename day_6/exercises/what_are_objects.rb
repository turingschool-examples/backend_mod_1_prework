Anything that can be said to have a vaule is an object; including numbers, strings, arrays, classes, modules.  Not objects: methods and blocks.

Objects are created from classes.  Classes are the molds and objects are what's produced from the molds.
Individua objects wil contain different information, yet they are instances of the same class.
