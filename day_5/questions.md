## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is more convenient to get used to than using an array, as an array is just holding variables. A hash is holding variables and assigning them values.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {dogs: 100, cats: 50, birds = 0}
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
stats{Iowa}
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
stats.keys
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
A hash is better than an array because when we use a has we are saving time by killing two birds with ones stone by being able to assign and use varaibles and their bvalues in one swift use.
