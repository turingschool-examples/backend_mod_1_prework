### Common Array Methods ###

1. sort
- sorts the elements of your array. If your array consists of numbers they will be sorted from lowest to highest. If your elements are strings they will be sorted by most characters to least. If your strings all have the same number of characters they will be sorted alphabetically.

1. each
- Allows you to iterate over your array by defining what you want to happen to each element in your array using {} after your array.each. After iterating your array it will return the original array.

1. collect
- Similar to each, it will iterate over the entire array using what you define in the block, however, array.collect will replace each element in the array with the new value created during the iteration and return that.

1. first
- Using array.first will simply display the first element in the array.

1. last
- Opposite of first, using array.last will simply display the last element in the array.

1. shuffle
- Using array.shuffle will return the elements of the array in random order.
