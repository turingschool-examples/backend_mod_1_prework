## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
the purpose of a method is to create a mini script with parameters that the code will run through as many times as told to create different outputs based on the same basic method.

2. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

3. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone('Asa')

5. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

I understand methods well, but I still have questions about the fundamentals of why and how return functions works within a method.
