####### Study Drills #######
# 2. only 4 places where a string is put inside a string
# 3. I know there are only 4 places because there is 1 string that has 2 strings within it. And two strings that have one string within
# 4. Adding w and e makes one string because ruby prints the first string and then prints the second string right after since it is an equation
# 5. Single quotes and double quotes do the same thing. They still work as long as it stays consistent in the code.
