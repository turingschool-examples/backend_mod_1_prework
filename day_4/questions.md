## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
- Methods/Functions allow you to break up your program into manageable pieces. Where each piece can handle a specific task.

2. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello()
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```

3. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

4. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```
$ hello_someone(sam)
```

5. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
