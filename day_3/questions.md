## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if booleanCondition

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You include elsif as another condition to check.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

if booleanCondition
  code to execute
elsif booleanCondition(2)
  code to execute
else
  code to execute
end
