## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
   The purpose of a method is to break down your code into little chunks
   that can be used in different parts of your code without having to rewrite it,
   and makes it easier to make changes.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
  ```Ruby
  def hello
    p "Sam I am"
  end
  ```
1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```Ruby
  def hello_someone(name)
    p "#{name} I am"
  end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```Ruby
  hello_someone("Jeff")
```
