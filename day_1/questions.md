1. How do we get input from a user? What is the method that we would use?  
We get input from a user by using the `print` command to ask the user for input, and then the `gets.chomp` method to store the input as a string assigned to a variable using `variable_name = gets.chomp` formatting.

1. Name and describe two common string methods.  
* One common string method is the `string.length` method, which returns the character length of the string.
* Another common string method is the `string.split` method, which splits the string into an array anywhere there are spaces. The `.split` method can also be used with an argument to split the string where there is a specific character, for example `string.split("t")` would split the string anywhere there is the letter "t".
