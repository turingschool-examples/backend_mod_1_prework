#CeasarCipher

```
The first thing to do to solve the Ceasar Cipher is to define *ceasar_cipher* with two parameters: a code/phrase (string) and how far you want each character shifted (integer). You then have to create a method that will encode your cipher. We want the method to be able to take a string of characters, and shift each letter *n* number of times. To do this, we need to create an array in our method with all 26 letters of the alphabet. To make it easier, you can use *('a'..'z').zip* because .zip will convert any argument into an array. Then, you can use the *rotate* method to allow you to shift each character *n* numbers of times as mentioned before. This method works only with arrays, which is why we needed to convert our alphabet into an array. Next, you'll create a *string.chars.map* method, where *.chars* takes each element of our alphabet array and converts in to a string, and *.map* which allows us to transform/shift our string characters. Using our *string.chars.map* method, along with *encode.fetch* to help us retrieve data from the array, within our *encode* method, we can tell our program what string we would like to make our cipher and how far we want our characters shifted. i.e. **p ceasar_cipher("Code or Message", 12).join**. The *.join* at the end will push all of the characters from our alphabet array together. Essentially, this code takes the string we give it, turns it into an array, shifts that array *n* number of spaces, and then converts that new array back into an encrypted string.
