# Day 3 - If Statements and Loops

One of the most important concepts in computer programming is knowing when and how to tell the computer to do either _one_ thing or _another_ thing based on a set of simple criteria.  We accomplish this with ***If-Statements*** and ***Loops***, which you will learn about today.

When you are all done with the lessons, exercises, and questions for today, you will once again use git to save your work locally, and then send your work to Github.

## Open your local copy of backend_module_0_capstone

Using your terminal, open your local copy of the forked repository you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to enter the directory that holds the repository. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the prework repository. Revisit [day_1](../day_1) for more detail if needed.

## If statement and Loop Lessons

1. Work through the following lessons. Any files that you create while working can be kept in today's `exercises` directory.

    - [x] [What If?](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex29.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [x] [Else and If](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex30.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [x] [Making Decisions](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex31.html) from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

    - [x] [Conditionals](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#9.-conditionals) from Ruby in 100 Minutes.

1. Work through the exercise files in the day_3/exercises directory.

1. Answer the questions in the questions.md file in the day_3 directory.

## Save your work in Git

When you are finished with all of the day_3 activities, enter the following commands in your terminal in order to save your work to your local git repository:

1. `$ git add day_3/exercises`
1. `$ git add day_3/questions.md`
1. Use `git add day_3/<filename>` to add all additional files that you created today
1. `$ git status` - you should see only green filenames - if you see any that are red, continue to `git add` those files until `git status` shows all green files.
1. `$ git commit -m "Add Day 3 Work"`

## Push to Github

Remember- You've saved your work to git on your **local** machine, but it is not yet accessible through your **remote** Github repository. Push your code up to Github with the following command:

```
git push origin master
```

You should now be able to log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote prework repository and see all the work you did today!
