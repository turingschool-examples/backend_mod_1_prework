# Ceasar Cipher

Create a file named caesar_cipher.rb

Store array of alphabetized text a-z.

  * Be sure to account for letters at the end of the array that would need to wrap.

  * Account for case of letters.

Write a method called encode that takes the user input of a string and an integer.

Break the string into an array of characters.

Use map/collect method and use the rotate method to use the user input integer
to shift the array by that many characters to form a new array for the encoding.

Determine the values of the user input string encoded with
the new value from the array that was created with the rotate method.

Print the return values as a string by converting the array back to a string.
