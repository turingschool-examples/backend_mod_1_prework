# Caesar Cipher Project 

1. I would create a CaesarCipher method that takes in a 'phrase' and 'shift' amount upon initialization.
1. I would create an array of the entire range of the alphabet in all caps.
1. Then I would make a method that would find the letter in the array 'shift' indexes before each letter in the in the phrase 

#Checkerboard Project 

1. I would create a method that takes in an argument of the size of the desired checkerboard.
1. I would create two nested loops using 'size.times'
1. The inner loop contains an if then statement that prints "X" on even numbers and " " on odd numbers
1. The outer one prints just one space on every other line to offset the X's and then prints a new line at the end of the row
