# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result. You should be able to run this
# file from your terminal with the command `ruby day_1/exercises/variables.rb`

# example: Write code that combines the variables below into another string:
name = "Ron"
team = "Chudley Cannons"

puts "This guy #{name} can't stand even hearing the team #{team}'s name"

# Write code that combines the variables below into a string that reads "The
# quick red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog":
speedy = "quick red fox"
slow_poke = "lazy brown dog"

puts "The #{speedy} jumped over the #{slow_poke}"

# Write code that combines the variables below into a string that reads "In a
# predictable result, the tortoise beat the hare!"
slow_poke = "tortoise"
speedy = "hare"

puts "For some wierd reason the #{speedy} lost to the #{slow_poke}, and I'm still confused as to why."
