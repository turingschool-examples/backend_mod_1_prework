puts "This will run."

#2 Reading backwards is hard
#3 no mistakes found

puts "I feel like I'm missing something here"
puts "In example 1 they specifically told us what to write (all the puts lines)."
puts "Based on the question why # was ignored in the quotes I feel like there was an external ex2 file I missed or instructions on what to do."
puts "There was nothing on the page for ex1 or ex2 on what should be in the ex2 file. Have a good grasp on the concepts, will move ex3."
