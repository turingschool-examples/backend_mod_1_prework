## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  - conditions are way that we can direct our computer to make decisions with information that it gathers or we give it.
  ```
  tacos = 3
  if tacos >= 10
    puts "I will accept your challenge to eat #{tacos} tacos!"
  else tacos <= 9
    puts "What is this amateur hour!?!? You think I cant eat more than #{tacos} tacos?!?!"
  end
  ```

 - allows you to tell the computer how to make a decision

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

 ```

  (what you want it to say)
 end

```

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

```
  if
  elsif
  else
