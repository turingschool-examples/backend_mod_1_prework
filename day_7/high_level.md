I struggled with this a lot so i've done my best to describe the steps I took

Caesar Cipher


Get input from user
  Find code that would be similar to .chomp for user input
   Ask for string text
   Ask for cipher shift number
   Ask for cipher shift direction
Convert input into Cipher
   Take user input
   Iterate over string text
     For every character in string, shift left or right on the alphabet by the integer the user specified
Display cipher text
  Return user modified string to console with a puts statement

  the result should be "Hhoor Wruog!"
