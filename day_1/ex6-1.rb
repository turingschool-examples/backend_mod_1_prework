# Exercise 6 Study Drills from LRTHW webpage.

# 1. Check ex6.rb
#
# 2. Lines:
#   10, 15, 17, and...
#   13 - I'm not sure if you would count this since it's a print command of a
#   "string inside of a string". I'm adding it since the directions state to list
#   "ALL the places where a string is put inside a string."
#
# 3. Yes, I'm sure. The only other possible lines are the following:
#
#   4 - I didn't count this because "technically" it's an integer inside of a string.
#   21 - I didn't count this because "technically" it's a boolean inside of a string.
#
# 4. You are adding the two strings together.
#
# 5. The single and double-quotes work "mostly" the same way. Normally you don't see them
#    when using the puts command and running the file in ruby BUT, you can show
#    them in ruby if you put them inside of each other. It works both ways as well.
# For example,
#      if you want to see '' printed > puts "I like the 'way' you move."
#      if you want to see "" printed > puts 'I like the "way" you move.'

#   The differences between the two is that the Single-Quotes can't hold/execute
#   string interpolation inside of the them. They also can't hold/print escape
#   sequences directly.
