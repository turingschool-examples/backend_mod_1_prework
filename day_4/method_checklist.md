# Method Checklist

+ Did you start your method definition with `def`?

+ Does your method name have only characters and `_` (underscore) characters?

+ Did you put an open parenthesis `(` right after the method name?

+ Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis `(` separated by commas?

+ Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?

+ Did you put a close parenthesis `)` after the arguments?  

+ Did you indent all lines of code you want in the method two spaces?

+ Did you end your method with `end` lined up with the `def` above?

## When you run ("use" or "call") a method, check these things:

+ Did you call/use/run this method by typing its name?

+ Did you put the `(` character after the name to run it?

+ Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?

+ Did you end the method call with a `)` character?

+ Functions that don't have parameters do not need the `()` after them, but would it be clearer if you wrote them anyways?

## To 'run', 'call', or 'use' a function all mean the same thing!
