## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

...The purpose of a method is to identify a code that we'll uses multiple times and set it apart so that we need only input it once.
1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

`def hello
p "Sam I am"
end `
1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

`def hello_someone(name)
puts "#{name} I am"
end`

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`hello_someone("Sam")`
1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

I'm still not clear on what `return` does.
