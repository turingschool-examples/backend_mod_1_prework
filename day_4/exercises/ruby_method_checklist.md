# Method Checklist
__________________
### When you define a method, check these things:  

1. Did you start your method definition with `def`?  
1. Does your method name have only characters and `_` characters (**snake_case**)?
1. Did you put an open parenthesis `(` right after the method name?
1. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis `(` separated by commas?
1. Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
1. Did you put a close parenthesis `)` after the arguments?
1. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the method two spaces?
1. Did you end your method with `end` lined up with the `def` above?

### When you run ("use" or "call") a method, check these things:

1. Did you call/use/run this method by typing its name?
1. Did you put the `(` character after the name to run it?
1. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
1. Did you end the method call with a `)` character?
1. Methods that don't have parameters do not need the `()` after them, but would it be clearer if you wrote them anyway?
