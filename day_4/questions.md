## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
- The purpose of a method is something that tells something else what to do. If you set up a method with an argument it will need to be called with an argument that it will interact with.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```Ruby
def hello
p "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
``` Ruby
def hello-someone(name)
p "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
- You would call the methods above by typing `hello` and the other one would be `hello-someone` with an argument of a name being passed in.

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
Not at the time.
