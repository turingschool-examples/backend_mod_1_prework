## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
If you need to run the same code many different times or applied to different
variables/elements it is easier to write a method that you can call to
apply to certain parameters than to retype the code each time.


1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello
p "Sam I Am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
p "#{name} I am"
end


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
hello_someone(Margo)

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
Is there a way to get ruby to autopopulate method options for you? If you type array.(want a list of options to come up)
