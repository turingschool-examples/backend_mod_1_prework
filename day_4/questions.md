## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?  
Creating your own methods allows you to run code easily without having to type out that code over and over. For instance, instead of having to write could to add to numbers together over and over, you could make a method that automatically adds to inputs together. This would drastically cut down work on a large project.  


1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.  
```
def hello
 puts "Sam i am"
end

```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.  
```
def hello_someone(name)
 puts "#{name} I am"
end

```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?  
`hello_someone("Sam")`  

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?  
*A:* Although I have learned how to make my own methods, I would like to see them in action in a more functional program. I want to see how they really interact in a large setting so I can get an even better idea of their importance.
